You can't just be up there and just doin' targeting like that.

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The defender is not allowed to hit the, uh, ball carrier, in a way that targets the ball carrier from, you know, just trying to run the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the defender is going for the tackle, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get you down! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to tackle low and then the runner goes low, you have to still tackle lower. You cannot not hit their head. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, go low at the ball carrier, and then, until you can’t touch their head.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have your head up here, like this, but then there's targeting you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Target hasn't been in any media in forever. I hope isn’t typecast as that store with a dog mascot in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, it was in Percy Jackson and the Olympians: the Titans curse too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

1c-b(3). Okay seriously though.

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The defender is not allowed to hit the, uh, ball carrier, in a way that targets the ball carrier from, you know, just trying to run the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the defender is going for the tackle, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get you down! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to tackle low and then the runner goes low, you have to still tackle lower. You cannot not hit their head. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, go low at the ball carrier, and then, until you can’t touch their head.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have your head up here, like this, but then there's targeting you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Target hasn't been in any media in forever. I hope isn’t typecast as that store with a dog mascot in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, it was in Percy Jackson and the Olympians: the Titans curse too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

Launch-a player leaving his feet to attack an opponent by an upward and forward thrust of the body to make forcible contact in the head or neck area.

A crouch followed by an upward and forward thrust to attack with forcible contact at the head or neck area, even though one or both feet are still on the ground.
