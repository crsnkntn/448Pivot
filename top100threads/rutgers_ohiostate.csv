And I'll be in bed by midnight after watching Oregon State play Colorado in the After Dark game.

3. Calls that go against osu are ignored and calls in our favor are called rigged

4. Defense plays great and carrys the offense eating glue for two quarters.

5. Game is close at half and everyone overreacts

6. Soft OSU fans claim we may never win a game again, but unironically.

7. Osu pulls away in the second half and everyone is still convinced we are actually terrible, including our own fan base.

In general is a little bit hard to take you seriously when you say that there is no chance that that player was targeting. The letter of the law talks about forcible contact to the head or neck, and there certainly was that, even to an extent where your own player actually got injured because of the hit he made on the play. 

Agreed that there were other chances to win that game that were left on the field in the red zone - credit to the Ohio State defense. Definitely a weakness for the RU offense. Despite that, this play was a 14 point swing and obviously it’s pretty easy to be upset about you. Have a great weekend. I hope you can find it in you to be objective in the future. I have no problem saying the OSU defense won that game. It’s a fact.

If Harrison has a QB that can isn’t terrible he is most likely #1 in heisman polls. At least several spots higher on draft day. 

Imagine if CJ was throwing to him again this year. It would look a lot more like DeVontas heisman year no doubt.",0,k7w8hi4,t3_17nng42,t1_k7w8hi4,t3_17nng42,/r/CFB/comments/17nng42/game_thread_ohio_state_rutgers_1200_pm_et/k7w8hi4/,1,1,0.0,1.45,1.45,0.0,1.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['ohiostate', 'stanford']"

He still has high school accuracy, high school timing, high school vision.
