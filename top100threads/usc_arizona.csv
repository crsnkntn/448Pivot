Don't forget that we led the departures not because we hate the Pac, but because we deserved more...and we finally had to go elsewhere to get paid more. The rest were too busy enabling Larry Scott. 

We've always been the villains to the others because national respect for the West Coast only peaks when USC is still good. Sure, Oregon and Washington have had good years... but did that get them an initial invite to the Big Ten? Nope. 

The conference expansion equation is no longer TV markets anymore (although us and, to a lesser extent, UCLA, are lynchpins to an enormous market), rather it's the teams that have a brand name bring in the national ratings. That's us, and it will always be us. We're the Blue Blood. Let them hate, it keeps them watching. 

The Pac-12 died because they just couldn't value the #1 brand in it.

So fast forward and apparently he now loves this unbeknownst to me.

So, he says he needs to pee again but we're in civilization like normal now. I pull to a grocery store where we shop because it's literally right there.

Nothing official whatsoever. Wasn’t mentioned in Big Noon (despite them being at our game), and only briefly mentioned during the beginning of the broadcast without any explanation. 

The message board rumor was he missed *a lot* of classes in a single week period, but there’s been nothing official to confirm (or contradict) it. 

Raleek is a different story… We brought in a new running back who’s much better than him, along with a guy who was rightfully ahead of him last year and a promising freshman.  

We asked him to move to wide receiver, which he did—but that’s also our most stacked position by far. He was competing for slot minutes with Branch; Washington, and Williams, who were all either established or outperforming him greatly. 

After the first three games he realized he was only playing garbage time and requested a redshirt so he could pursue other options next season. Has been posting Instagram lives during the games since then when he’s not even present. 

He’s an undersized RB and doesn’t quite have the hands (yet) to be a wideout at a big power 5 school. He’s also doesn’t quite have the speed advantage we hoped he’d have at this level. He’s still very quick with his moves but his straight away speed isn’t quite as good as we’d hoped as he gets caught quite often. 

I wish the best for the guy, but he’ll have a tough time at most bigger schools unless he develops a lot this offseason.",0,k3y7bln,t3_172mpmi,t1_k3y7bln,t1_k3y6h5n,/r/CFB/comments/172mpmi/game_thread_arizona_usc_1030_pm_et/k3y7bln/,1,1,2.31,0.0,1.15,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,['usc']

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of watchers of this game has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a game to be unworthy of my time. These include, but are not limited to:

Bad QB play,

Bad refereeing,

Team I don't like is winning.  

Will you turn the game back on?

No - maybe next week. But these teams should avoid playing a game like this again. Otherwise I will be forced to turn the channel again, which may put your football TV revenues in jeopardy.",0,k3yb5zt,t3_172mpmi,t1_k3yb5zt,t3_172mpmi,/r/CFB/comments/172mpmi/game_thread_arizona_usc_1030_pm_et/k3yb5zt/,2,2,2.97,2.97,1.98,0.0,1.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,['northcarolina']

THEDumbasscus,t2_8k06l,1696810786,[],,False,"I don’t think we’re *that* far off on an objective assessment of the program. I’m not even sure the program is quality like their historic blue chip status is leading people to believe. This is the most Lincoln Riley team I’ve ever seen, for better and for worse. To the point where I’d humor demoting him to Offensive Coordinator if I was SC’s Athletic Director but his name is too big. 

I just think Caleb can get it done to at least a 10 win level. This game would have been one I think the Trojans would have dropped, and almost understood them dropping it. But Caleb won it on his own like you said. He’s getting serious consideration as a back to back Heisman guy for good reason, I don’t trust Notre Dame to keep up in a shootout, and I also expect the team to rally for a rivalry game.",0,k42cmjo,t3_172mpmi,t1_k42cmjo,t1_k40n9sq,/r/CFB/comments/172mpmi/game_thread_arizona_usc_1030_pm_et/k42cmjo/,1,1,3.29,1.32,1.32,0.66,0.66,0.0,0.66,0.0,[]
