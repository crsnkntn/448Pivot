This obviously doesn't happen very often-- I don't remember seeing many penalties on the offense on field goals other than the occasional false start, which is a dead ball foul and doesn't qualify for the 10 second runoff-- but it seems like a consideration.  You'd probably need to kick with like 16 seconds left (to account for the length of time the play takes, and still leave a second on the clock after the runoff)-- what are the odds of the other team scoring with 16 seconds?  Which unlikely event is more likely?  Alternately, if you're taking a timeout ""to get he play right"", maybe you should just be calling the play that you have on you sheet for that situation and saving a timeout so you can avoid the runoff?  Again, how often does the extra time for a timeout really wind up helping to get the play call right (and also needing to account for the number of times the extra time helps the defense instead)?
