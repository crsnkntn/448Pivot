Why 4 downs? Why a 40 second play clock? 11 players? That's a silly number. Why care how many players need to be on the line of scrimmage? All of these rules evolved to make the game more interesting. The current force for evolving the game is ""CFP games take forever. Mainly because of the length of commercial breaks, but we can't touch those, so what can we take out to make a better TV product?"". I don't think that's a good philosophy for driving rule change.

>Also, where are they going to add commercials?

Uh, the same places they've always added commercials? Most easily by making existing breaks longer, and also breaking in places where they previously didn't - like reviews and injuries and then extending those breaks as well. 

>It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre just randomly going to pop them in the middle of a drive

This comment is going to age like milk. Keep an eye out at the bottom of your screen and ads that don't require cutting away from the game.

If their actual offense played those 21 points he gifted them is too much to over come. 

As for the ""complicated"" scheme, are you talking the one where Drew Pyne threw 22 TDs against 6 INTs and lost only *one* game? Cause if I remember correctly, before the SCar game Buchner had, 0 TDs, 2 INTs and won *zero* games. Same team, same scheme, the only difference was the QB. 8-1 record vs. 0-2 and one of those loses was to *Marshall* 

If he plays that whole season last year, we lose to Cal, UNC, BYU, Syracuse and Clemson and probably one or two more on top of that.
