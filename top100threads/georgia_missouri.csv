Pass Interference Rules

1) You can't just be out there and just do pass interference like that.

1a. Pass interference is when you

1b. Okay well listen. Pass interference is when you hit the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The defender is not allowed to do a hit to the, uh, receiver, that prohibits the receiver from doing, you know, just trying to get open. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the passer is throwing a pass, a defender can't go to a receiver like, ""I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna hitcha before the ball gets there! I'm gonna interfere with the pass!"" You can't do that.

1c-b(2). You gotta be, playing the ball, and then, until you just play the ball.
