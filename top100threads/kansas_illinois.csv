You can't just be up there and just doin' targeting like that.

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The defender is not allowed to hit the, uh, ball carrier, in a way that targets the ball carrier from, you know, just trying to run the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the defender is going for the tackle, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get you down! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to tackle low and then the runner goes low, you have to still tackle lower. You cannot not hit their head. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, go low at the ball carrier, and then, until you can’t touch their head.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have your head up here, like this, but then there's targeting you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Target hasn't been in any media in forever. I hope isn’t typecast as that store with a dog mascot in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, it was in Percy Jackson and the Olympians: the Titans curse too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

Note 1: ""Targeting"" means that a player takes aim at an opponent for purposes of attacking with forcible contact that goes beyond making a legal tackle or a legal block or playing the ball. Some indications of targeting (emphasis NCAA's) include but are not limited to:

Launch-a player leaving his feet to attack an opponent by an upward and forward thrust of the body to make forcible contact in the head or neck area
A crouch followed by an upward and forward thrust to attack with forcible contact at the head or neck area, even though one or both feet are still on the ground
Leading with helmet, shoulder, forearm, fist, hand or elbow to attack with forcible contact at the head or neck area
Lowering the head before attacking by initiating forcible contact with the crown of the helmet",0,jzrjjyi,t3_16doerv,t1_jzrjjyi,t1_jzrinno,/r/CFB/comments/16doerv/game_thread_illinois_kansas_730_pm_et/jzrjjyi/,1,1,0.68,3.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"

Note 1: ""Targeting"" means that a player takes aim at an opponent for purposes of attacking with forcible contact that goes beyond making a legal tackle or a legal block or playing the ball. Some indications of targeting (emphasis NCAA's) include but are not limited to:

Launch-a player leaving his feet to attack an opponent by an upward and forward thrust of the body to make forcible contact in the head or neck area.

A crouch followed by an upward and forward thrust to attack with forcible contact at the head or neck area, even though one or both feet are still on the ground.

Leading with helmet, shoulder, forearm, fist, hand or elbow to attack with forcible contact at the head or neck area.

KU touchdown called back due to questionable inconsequential block in back.

Illinois 2 point conversion failed but targeting called for hitting a QB in the only 10 inch square you're allowed to hit a QB.

Illinois 2 point conversion ""confirmed"" because a ref can't guess where the ball is behind a glove.

KU called for targeting for a shoulder to shoulder hit when the defender RAN PAST THE RECEIVER with glancing contact.
