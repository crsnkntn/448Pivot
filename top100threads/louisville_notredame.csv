They didn’t look up for it at ALL today. At ALL. Worst this team has looked overall in terms of being completely outclassed since idk- 2019 Michigan? Just absolutely pathetic.

You won’t do it but Gerad Parker needs to have his playcalling stripped immediately. Give Stuckey or McCullough a shot they’re the only coaches worth a damn on this staff. 

Who knows maybe this is just the expectations clearer event this team needed to move away from the CFP and towards a more realistic goal. It sucks to think about, but it could be the case. Guess we’ll see next week.
