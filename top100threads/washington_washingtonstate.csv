If Texas gets to play and get revenge on 10-2 OU instead of playing 9-3 OSU, that's a pretty big difference and gives them the same argument we have of being able to say ""we beat everyone on our schedule"" if we also beat Washington.

Additionally, Washington losing today will likely see them fall below Alabama (as long as they don't lose to Auburn, which is also weirdly happening right now). The only difference in our resumes could be whether the committee views their Alabama win as better than our Washington win should we beat them in the SEC championship.
