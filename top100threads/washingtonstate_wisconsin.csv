WSU and OSU have both been in this same conference for over 100 years! So even without the bylaws, which clearly show we’re the only ones now with the right to vote: We have every right to continue our conference legacy. I don’t care about the money. Split up this years revenue equally with the leavers. Don’t try to punish them. Hell, split up the ~90 million pending from basketball NCAA units.  We’re already financially left behind. Don’t care.     

In truth, I think the other school presidents just don’t want to see the Pac12 continue without them in it. Even if it’s no longer considered a “power” conference.  They want the conference dead so in the future no one can question their decision to leave. But fuck that! We’re not dead. Invite all of the Mountain West. We’re not going anywhere.

It's if a player TAKES THE BALL into the endzone and fails to extend the ball out of it.  For it to be marked down in the endzone the ENTIRE BALL must be behind the line.

Try again.  You don't know the rules and this is painful trying to educate you on this when you clearly don't know them. 

>And where did the fucking “forward progress” argument go? You dropped that real quick. 

No where, because you failed to get this.  Forward progress is marked at the point where the ball is when the ball is moved backward by the defender's momentum.  The ball was clearly outside of the endzone when they happened.  Welcome to the rules.

And the entire ball was beyond the line. This is not hard. Your QB was headed backwards and when he was down, the ball was beyond the line. Any idiot could see that. 

> Try again.  You don't know the rules and this is painful trying to educate you on this when you clearly don't know them.

Ironic coming from a guy who doesn’t understand a simple concept like “forward progress”

Literally only the case when the ball is moving TOWARDS THE ENDZONE. Forward progress doesn’t apply at all if you’re moving yourself backwards.
