I grew up generationally with football and only watch Michigan games (even then, seldomly because of work), but knowing that Michigan can easily be good without cheating, then resorting to something so stupid is kind of awful.

While the drama itself is funny, it's also pathetic.
I hope they play this season to the best of their ability, and I hope they stopped the bullshit.

Seeing Michigan beat Ohio State is an amazing experience, but cheating throws a whole cloud of ambiguity into it. Did they in 2021? Did they in 2022? I'd like to believe so, but I'm waiting on what the investigations turn.
