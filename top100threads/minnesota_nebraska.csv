No. Our goal with multiview is to make it available to everyone with a television. Since most devices don’t have the hardware to support multiview, we have to do all of the processing of video feeds on our servers to make multiview possible.

This means that every unique combination watched in multiview uses limited data center and computational resources. Because each region has unique, local content, we are especially constrained on the number of combinations we can create that include local feeds. We try to select the best combinations based on expected popularity, and are always improving our processes.""

The team played much more deliberately. Minus the turnovers the offense allowed the D to rest. Huddling and playing slower benefits this team.   


The special team play was good. We actually got returns. Our kicking game was reliable and it looks like we have a solid young placekicker. 

It feels like the three phases of the team are on the same page and helping each other. (If we don't turn it over that is.)  In a strategic game plan way, the team makes more sense now than it did during Frost.  


There's a lot of sloppy stuff and it feels like it's been that way forever. It takes time to build discipline. Hopefully, Rhule can do it.
