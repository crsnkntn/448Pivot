Genuinely puzzling why ESPN chose to make Colorado their crown jewel this year rather than USC. No one under 30 remembers watching Deion play ball, and yet all of this Coach Prime marketing is targeted toward young people. I truly don't get it.

Decades ago in Texas, there was a high school team that was horrible.

The team was pumped for it. They practiced harder than ever. They were totally psyched up to beat their rival despite going 0-9 into that game.

They went up 7-0 on their first series, and were so pumped and the crowd was on their side.

They lost 10-63. 

Because when the other team actually started playing like they had trained for the entire season, the hype just couldn't keep up.

Florida and UCLA are better wins. Luckily Utah has a bye next week and then a game against Cal so hopefully our starters can be healthy when Utah continue playing ranked teams. BTW I understand what you're trying to say but at the same time you have to admit since the first game with how many Utah starters have been out and more keep getting injured Utah kept winning until last night. Just imagine if Utah was healthy, I'm not saying they would steam roll Georgia if they were healthy but being 4-1 with alot of starters out since week 1 and it kept continuing is a huge accomplishment in my mind and those starters most not all will be back.",0,k2wyz31,t3_16w91ub,t1_k2wyz31,t1_k2w90k6,/r/CFB/comments/16w91ub/game_thread_usc_colorado_1200_pm_et/k2wyz31/,0,0,8.18,1.26,1.26,0.63,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['utah', 'florida']"
