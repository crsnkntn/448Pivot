Residentcarthrowaway,t2_hx1k3kcn,1696042855,[],,False,"Play Name: Singleback Twin TE Cross
Formation:
Singleback formation with the quarterback (QB) under center.
Two tight ends (TE1 and TE2) on either side of the offensive line.
Two wide receivers (WR1 and WR2); WR1 lined up to the left and WR2 lined up to the right.
One running back (RB) directly behind the QB.
Play Description:
At the Snap:
QB takes the snap under center.
RB initially steps forward as if to run, then blocks any immediate pressure to protect the QB.
Wide Receivers Routes:
WR1 runs a deep go-route, aiming to stretch the field vertically and pull the cornerback and safety with him.
WR2 runs a 5-yard out-route, looking to draw the attention of the cornerback and the outside linebacker on his side.
Tight Ends Routes:
TE1 (left side) runs a deep crossing route over the middle aiming to reach a depth of about 10-15 yards before crossing.
TE2 (right side) runs a shorter crossing route, aiming to cross the field at about 5 yards depth.
Quarterback Progression:
QB drops back and reads the defense.
The first read is TE1 on the deep crossing route. If he is covered, the QB progresses to TE2 on the short crossing route.
If both tight ends are covered, the QB checks down to WR2 on the out route.
Finally, if all primary receivers are covered, QB can look to WR1 deep or run the ball if there is open field.",0,k2td1gj,t3_16vrr41,t1_k2td1gj,t1_k2tcrs9,/r/CFB/comments/16vrr41/game_thread_utah_oregon_state_900_pm_et/k2td1gj/,2,2,1.25,0.83,0.83,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.42,0.42,[]

Indicators of targeting include: (1) launching, (2) upward thrust, (3) forcible contact to head or neck area, and (4) lowering head



The indicator of targeting present on that play had to be lowering the head, but how is that any different than hitting with the crown of the helmet? Like, what possible hit could happen with the crown of the helmet where the player doesnt lower their head?

The requirement that there is an indicator of targeting makes you think that it’s leading with crown and something else, but really the penalty is just hit with the crown of the helmet.

There are 4 quarters, each 20 minutes. You have to bounce or get rid of the ball (via handballing/punching/kicking, not throwing) every 15 meters you run, and if you cleanly catch a ball kicked 15 meters you get a mark, which is the whistle you hear all the time, when you get some time to stop if you want. Free kicks are given for marks or penalties (where they might advance you 50 meters as well).

> Australian rules football grounds, even at the highest level of the game, have no fixed dimensions. For senior football, the playing field is an oval, typically between 135–185 metres (148–202 yd) long goal-to-goal and 110–155 metres (120–170 yd) wide wing-to-wing. Grounds can vary from long and narrow to almost circular, and are not necessarily symmetrical, depending upon how and where the field was constructed. At least 5 metres (5.5 yd) of space between the boundary line and any fence is required for safety.

I’ve always heard of how the college sports have the biggest/truest fan bases in the states, but that they keep making mistakes and fucking over the athletes etc. I didn’t realise they messed with the league itself to that degree! Unreal!

In AFL the support base buy memberships each year - and that’s like the majority of the clubs income for the year - members also get voting say (to a degree, not so much anymore) on major decisions for the club, like CEO, Board etc. It’s kind of like owning a share in a company…

I feel this has gone a long way over the 150yrs of the league in keeping it still for the fans, by the fans. And staved off some of the greed attempts by corporations. Fan bases have gone on strike/boycotts in the past to be heard by their clubs and leagues - and teams have folded/merged as a result.
