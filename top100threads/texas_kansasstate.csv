Yes! Just posted same thing above. You get stuffed at the 4 YL twice, why go for it AGAIN? Kick the FG and play on. 

Before that when it was 27-27, kick the PAT to take the lead! Demoralizing for Texas, maybe keeps momentum with KSU. But no, he goes for 2, fails, now Texas gets some of that momentum back.

If you kick the field goal and go into 2OT, the game starts new. Your team has been fighting hard, but have you finally asked too much? Are they deflated because their all out just gets them to parity?  Maybe this time UT gets lucky.  Maybe UT finds their mojo and gets a touchdown and you don’t even get near the end zone and you’re left with an even more desperate play.  Maybe you don’t get the coin toss and you have to gamble that your field goal will hold up. All that is promised is that you’ll start over.  

You have great field position and you only need a few yards to end the game. This probably is your best chance to win as K-State. It just sucks that it’s one play and not a huge percentage play. 

Of course if you think you’re the better team, kick the field goal and go to 2OT.  Then again, if you think you’re the better team, why not just take your shot and sink the dagger?
