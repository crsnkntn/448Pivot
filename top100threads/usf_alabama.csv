Usually, elite 5 star caliber  prospects start by their redshirt freshman year. Here's a list of them & their circumstances over the last 10 seasons (since 2013) and whether or not they started by their 2nd season:(Note: ESPN & Rivals will be in parentheses if the recruit received a 5 star rating by the more strict ESPN system & more lenient Rivals. Consensus if 5 star by all 3 of 247, Rivals & ESPN.)

Hackenberg - Stayed at Penn State despite their bowl ban for obvious reasons. True Freshman

Max Browne - No, Backup to Kessler in consecutive years.

Kyle Allen - Yes

Deshaun Watson (Rivals) - Yes

Josh Rosen - True Freshman

Stidham - Backup as true freshman. Left following Art Briles fallout. DNP in 2016. Transferred to Auburn. Starter in 2017 & 2018.

Barnett (ESPN) - Lost Starting Job to Hurts (Considering how Hurts turned out, doesn't look all too bad in hindsight for Blake.)

Kyler - (ESPN) Committed to A&M while Kyle Allen was still there. Played 3 games as a true freshman. Transferred to Oklahoma in 2016 & was forced to sit out the season. Backup to 3rd in 2016 Heisman Voting Baker Mayfield in 2017 when he returned. Started his lone season in 2018.

Patterson - Yes

Eason - True Freshman

Davis Mills - No, Backup to KJ Costello in 2018 & 2019, Started in shortened 2020 Covid Season

Kellen Mond (Rivals) - Yes

Jake Fromm (Rivals) - Started as True Freshman after an injury to Jacob Eason in the season opener. (\*)

Hunter Johnson (Rivals) - No, Transferred to Northwestern the spring after Trevor Lawrence committed to Clemson. Didn't start in 2018.

Tua - Yes not to mention of course what happened in the National Championship Game

Trevor Lawrence (ESPN, Consensus) - Became Starter midseason as True Freshman

Fields (ESPN, Consensus) - Yes

J.T Daniels - True Freshman, Started at 2 Top 15 all-time programs but injuries have marred his career.

Spencer Rattler - Yes

Bo Nix (Rivals) - True Freshman

Bryce Young (ESPN, Consensus) - Yes

DJ Uiagalelei - Yes

Harrison Bailey (Rivals) - No, while he started few games his true freshman season, Pruitt was finally fired & replaced by a guy who didn't fit the system he wanted to run. Was the 3rd string for the 2021 season. Transferred to UNLV in mid-2021 & got beat out for the starting job in 2022.

CJ Stroud - Yes

Caleb Williams - Became Starter midseason as True Freshman over Rattler

Sam Huard - No, Michael Penix Jr. & Dylan Morris both transferred to Washington in 2022. Penix Jr. beat out Morris & Huard for the starting job. Huard becomes the 3rd string & transfers to an FCS school.

Drake Maye - Yes

Ty Thompson (Rivals) - Bo Nix transferred to Oregon in 2022. Has been his backup each of the last 2 seasons. (\*)

Brock Vandagriff (Rivals) - No, Stetson Bennett returned for one final college season to repeat as national champions. Lost the backup (2022) & starting position (2023) to Carson Beck in consecutive years.

Quinn Ewers (ESPN, Consensus) - Yes, reclassified to 2021 so he could get to the NFL a year earlier. Stayed a year at Ohio State but transferred to Texas (because he never had any intention to play for Ohio State especially with CJ Stroud there).

Ty Simpson - No, 3rd string QB behind Jalen Milroe & Tyler Buchner.

Klubnik - Yes, started the ACC Championship & Orange Bowl at the end of his True Freshman season.

Weigman - Yes, started a few games his True Freshman season due to injuries to other QBS.

Allar - Yes

Walker Howard (Rivals) - With Jayden Daniels returning for another season, Howard transferred to rival Ole Miss & is the 3rd string behind Spencer Sanders & of course, Jaxson Dart. (\* I'll reserve judgment on Howard for now.)

So over the last decade of college football, of the 30+ 5 star recruits at QB, 19 of them started either as a true freshman or a redshirt. I'll excuse Stidham due to unforeseen circumstances & Kyler because he was forced to miss 2016 & no chance in hell he was beating out a guy who finished 3rd in Heisman voting after he decided to return for his senior season after he was given a year of eligibility for transferring within the conference. Maybe could excuse Blake Barnett in hindsight because he got ""Wally Pipped"" by Jalen Hurts & look how well the latter's football career turned out. Being one of only 4 (or 5) 5 stars to not start by your 2nd year is really not a good look for Simpson & he's 3rd on the depth chart. 

Looking like Ty Simpson may be a college bust if he's worse than both Milroe & Buchner.",0,k0wk17y,t3_16keh8t,t1_k0wk17y,t3_16keh8t,/r/CFB/comments/16keh8t/game_thread_alabama_usf_330_pm_et/k0wk17y/,-4,-4,1.27,1.9,0.89,0.25,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.13,['rcfb']
