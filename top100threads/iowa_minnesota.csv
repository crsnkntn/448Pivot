Each individual bit held in itself its own infinite bits. The bits in those, the same. It is not as though I can't understand time; simply that seeing it eventually becomes nothing but a tiny dot on a canvas stretching to everywhere. In this expanse, every single breath a unknowable amount of unending universal lifetimes.

But as with any art, the time spent understanding it allows one to see the elements that some may miss. I have become some sort of partner to this infinite painting; I can finally see it all - all at once, as one.

> During Team A’s punt from the A-20, receiver B44 points at the grounded punt at midfield. As B44 points at the ball, (a) he keeps his hands below his shoulders with no waving motion; (b) he keeps his hands below his shoulders and has a waving motion; (c) he has his hands just above the shoulders with no waving motion. **RULING:** Rule 2-8-3 states that any waving motion that does not meet the criteria for a valid signal is an invalid signal. Additionally, by interpretation the receiver is allowed to point at a kick as long as his hands remain below the shoulder and there is no waving motion. Both (b) and (c) would be an Invalid Fair Catch Signal. In (a), this would not be considered a signal at all, and Team B would retain the right to recover the ball and advance.

> During Team A’s punt from the A-20, receiver B44 points at the grounded punt at midfield. As B44 points at the ball, (a) he keeps his hands below his shoulders with no waving motion; (b) he keeps his hands below his shoulders and has a waving motion; (c) he has his hands just above the shoulders with no waving motion. **RULING:** Rule 2-8-3 states that any waving motion that does not meet the criteria for a valid signal is an invalid signal. Additionally, by interpretation the receiver is allowed to point at a kick as long as his hands remain below the shoulder and there is no waving motion. Both (b) and (c) would be an Invalid Fair Catch Signal. In (a), this would not be considered a signal at all, and Team B would retain the right to recover the ball and advance.

Additionally, by interpretation the receiver is allowed to point at a kick as long as his hands remain below the shoulder and there is no waving motion.

b. Player beyond the neutral zone when kicking the ball (Rule 12-3-4-b).  
  
c. Blocking by players of the kicking team before they are eligible to touch the ball on an onside kick (Rule 12-3-4-e).  
  
d. The number of players on the field for either team during a live ball (Rule 12-3-6-a).  
  
e. Illegal touching of a forward pass by an originally eligible receiver who has gone out of bounds or touching of a forward pass by an originally ineligible player (Rules 12-3-2-b and 12-3-3-h).  
  
f. A player touching or recovering a kick or loose ball who is or has been out of bounds during the kick. (Rule 12-3-4-f).  
  
g. Forward pass that becomes illegal as a second pass after an on-field ruling of a backward pass is reversed (Rule 12-3-2-e).

The player was running and arm movement is a natural part of running. If he was doing that while standing in place waiting for the ball to drop I would agree that he is signaling. But arm movement while running to the ball is expected and not an invalid signal. You can't expect that every punt is going to go right to where the punt receiver starts the play at. They are more times than not going to have to run somewhere and that will come with arm movement.

He was also pointing with the other arm and not moving it. I have never seen a player point to a ball he is about to catch, or point somewhere else while trying to catch a ball. There was absolutely no reason to think he was going to fair catch the ball or was trying to deceive the defense into thinking he was going to by what he was doing with either arm.

In addition, both the refs and the other team are specifically looking to see if he signals for a fair catch, so it's not like no one was looking at what he was doing. Yet no refs felt compelled to call it on the field AND we saw every Minnesota player go after him as soon as he got the ball, which is not what a player who was deceived into thinking he might have signaled for a fair catch.

To be clear, I am not arguing that it is indisputable that he did NOT commit an invalid signal. He may have. Or maybe he didn't. It's disputable.

But it was not called on the field, and that is all that matters. Because the call by it's very nature is called when something is disputable. A player either undisputably signals for a fair catch. Or they undisputably did not call for a fair catch. Review can overturn both of those situations if they ever get called wrong IF there is undisputable evidence that they did or did not call for a fair catch. But the whole reason the invalid signal call exists is when a ref can't say one way or the other that they did or didn't signal a fair catch.
