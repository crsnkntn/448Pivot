Young team.  Offense needs work.
Coach Saban is our ride or die Coach for as long as he chooses.

  We are accounting professors at a large SEC university (let you guess).

  These kids are not ready for university:
Not emotionally, academically, maturity.

 Do you know how hard it is to try to track responsibility and accountability to public school kids who are academically at the 5th grade level - or lower. 

  They do not have the maturity or patience to learn difficult concepts and, because they were never failed in class just passed based on their birthday, they have a very hard time learning plays. 

 Not their fault the public schools failed them.  The teachers and the teacher unions are at fault.  #1? The US Dept of Education that is filled with radicals experimenting on our children.

  The greatest gift we can give our children is to teach them to behave, respect for elders, respect for authority, accountability for themselves and get them OUT of public schools because the 67% of high school grads who are on the 5th grade academic level?

 That is nationwide across ALL schools.
