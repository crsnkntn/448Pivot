I'm scraping all the comments from the game threads / post game threads this year to try and get a sense of how big each fanbase is on here, how often they comment, etc, and so far through last night's games A&M flairs are absolutely dominating every other flair. There are less than 400 unique A&M flairs commenting so far, but they're still beating out Michigan and Ohio State's ~1,000 unique users just because they comment so much.

So I guess basically what I'm saying is that advanced metrics show A&M fans are the most passionate so far this season. Here's the top 10 by total comments made:
