The Iowa Hawkeyes, led by their offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz, were facing the formidable Michigan Wolverines for the conference title. The tension in the air was palpable, as both teams battled for supremacy on the gridiron.  
  
Throughout the season, Ferentz had been quietly developing a secret offensive strategy that he believed would give Iowa the edge they needed in the championship game. He had meticulously designed and practiced a set of plays that deviated from the team's usual style, keeping the new tactics under wraps until the perfect moment.  
  
As the game unfolded, it became evident that Michigan's defense was tough and disciplined, making it difficult for the Hawkeyes to gain significant yardage. The first half was a defensive battle, with both teams struggling to put points on the board. The tension in the stadium grew with every possession, and the fans could sense that something extraordinary was about to happen.  
  
At halftime, Ferentz gathered his players in the locker room, and a sense of anticipation filled the air. The offensive coordinator, known for his strategic mind, revealed his secret plan to the team. He had crafted a series of plays designed to exploit the weaknesses in Michigan's defense, utilizing misdirection, unconventional formations, and unexpected player rotations.  
  
The second half began, and the Hawkeyes took the field with a newfound confidence. Iowa executed the first play flawlessly, completing a deep pass that caught the Wolverines off guard. The Iowa offense moved with precision, seamlessly transitioning between plays that left the Michigan defense scrambling to adjust.  
  
As the Hawkeyes continued to implement Ferentz's secret playbook, they scored one touchdown after another. The once stoic Michigan defense was left bewildered, unable to predict the next move. The Iowa fans in the stadium erupted in cheers as their team took control of the game.  
  
The final minutes of the championship game ticked away, and the Hawkeyes held a commanding lead. Brian Ferentz's masterfully kept secret had been unleashed at the most critical moment, securing a historic victory for Iowa. The players celebrated on the field, hoisting the Big Ten Championship trophy high in the air.  
  
In the post-game press conference, reporters bombarded Ferentz with questions about the mysterious offensive strategy that had propelled Iowa to victory. With a wry smile, he explained the months of planning, the dedication of the players, and the belief that sometimes, a well-kept secret could be the key to success.  
  
The Hawkeyes' triumph in the Big Ten Championship was not only a testament to their skill on the field but also a nod to the strategic brilliance of Brian Ferentz, whose secret offensive arsenal had become the stuff of legends in college football.",0,kbrcka5,t3_189go15,t1_kbrcka5,t3_189go15,/r/CFB/comments/189go15/game_thread_iowa_vs_michigan_800_pm_et/kbrcka5/,14,14,5.21,3.04,2.39,0.87,1.08,0.0,1.08,0.0,['iowa']

If it's 7, it's a reverse, with the direction dictated by the divisibility of the larger number. If it's divisible by 2, run left. If it's not, run right.

Washington and Michigan are auto-in

From there, it gets complicated.

Texas, Georgia, FSU, OSU, and Bama.

In my mind, there are 2 easy outs, FSU and OSU.

Florida St missing their QB will play into the committees eyes as being a less of a team.

OSU for not making their conference championship should be the dagger. There is no sane way to keep them ahead of Bama/Texas given their performance this weekend, Texas blowing out OKST and Bama beating the 1 seed.

That leaves Texas, Bama, and Gerogia.

Texas beat Bama, Bama beat Gerogia. By the transitive law, Geeogia is the weak link, but let's look further.

Georgia is 3-1 in current ranked games, the highest win being number 9

Bama is 4-1 in current ranked games, the highest win being number 1

Texas is 3-1 in current ranked games, the highest being number 8 (Bama)

In my mind, Bama and Texas have a better look on paper. They both have better wins than Georgia and the same or better record against ranked teams.

That leaves me to believe the final rankings would be:

1. Michigan, 2. Washington, 3. Texas, 4. Bama, 5. Georgia, 6. OSU, 7. FSU

If FSU wins, then honestly flip a coin between Texas/Bama, but I think Texas gets the nod having beat Bama straight up.

***Why The SEC Does Not Deserve A CFP Bid***

Hear me out before you get your pitchforks (if you’re a SEC homer) or call me a sore loser.


***NEITHER*** UGA nor Alabama deserve to be in the playoff.


**Georgia**

Why the f@@k anyone still thinks we have a chance to make the CFP is beyond me. This team laid a turd against an Alabama team that needed a 4th & 32 Hail Mary against Auburn. Even if we had won, Mike Bobo showed enough ineptitude tonight as Offensive Coordinator to remind us all that Richt hanging on to Bobo for a season or two too long is what did Richt in at UGA. Bobo is never ***the*** problem, but he is always the ***source*** of many problems. So anyway, yeah, RIP UGA three-peat hopes.

***Alabama***

Are we ***SERIOUSLY*** considering Alabama for the CFP if both Michigan and FSU win? 

Let me reiterate…

- Alabama lost to Texas by ten ***at home***
- Alabama needed a 4th & 32 miracle to beat Auburn
- They needed a doink-miss FG and a phantom 4th & 2, egregiously unreviewed ‘catch’, and Mike Bobo being Mike Bobo, to beat Georgia by ***three*** points.


UGA played like absolute dog crap and as a UGA alum, I have no problem admitting it. But the committee doesn’t get to have their cake and eat it too.

A playoff worthy Alabama team would have won that game against UGA’s piss poor performance by at least 21.

Texas waxed Alabama at home and Alabama needed a 4th & 32 miracle at Auburn and an ***EGREGIOUS*** no-review by the refs on Bonds 4th & 2 ghost catch ***to even be in the conversation***

Case closed. End of story. 

Texas > Alabama

If it goes any other way, assuming FSU and Michigan win, then this sport is dead to me, because we’ll finally have confirmation that the season is just a WWE spectacle and the CFP Committee is Vince McMahon.",0,kbri5xz,t3_189go15,t1_kbri5xz,t3_189go15,/r/CFB/comments/189go15/game_thread_iowa_vs_michigan_800_pm_et/kbri5xz/,-10,-10,2.22,1.98,1.23,0.49,0.74,0.0,0.25,0.0,['georgia']

Offense
- terrible execution - Oline play horrendous, our best downfield threat drops an explosive. 

-Props to Iowas defense but I think the playcalling is too conservative, but may be hampered due to the olines performance

- this performance would lead the team to get blown out by any cfp team other than fsu, and lose to osu too. Just disappointing 

Defense/STs
- iowa is terrible offensively but of course still good job on defense. Mike with the fumble and almost int - I’m gonna miss this guy so much

- semaj had the big return, but also gave up 30 yards of field position on various decisions to not fair catch

- I’m fine with the field goal on 4th and 1. Clearly points are at a premium and Iowas d is excellent",0,kbrl5ki,t3_189go15,t1_kbrl5ki,t3_189go15,/r/CFB/comments/189go15/game_thread_iowa_vs_michigan_800_pm_et/kbrl5ki/,2,2,4.58,6.11,4.58,1.53,3.05,0.0,0.76,0.76,"['michigan', 'lsu']"

""Hey! What gives you the right  
To put up a fence to keep me out  
But to keep Mother Nature in?  
If God was here, he'd tell you to your face  
'Man, you're some kind of sinner'""  
Sign, sign  
Everywhere a sign  
Blockin' out the scenery  
Breakin' my mind  
Do this, don't do that  
Can't you read the sign?  
Now, hey you, mister, can't you read?  
You got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat  
You can't even watch, no, you can't eat  
You ain't supposed to be here  
The sign said, ""You've got to have a membership card  
To get inside""  
Uh  
And the sign said  
""Everybody welcome  
Come in, kneel down and pray""  
But when they passed around the plate at the end of it all  
I didn't have a penny to pay  
So I got me a pen and a paper  
And I made up my own little sign  
I said, ""Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me  
I'm alive and doin' fine""  
Woo!  
Sign, sign  
Everywhere a sign  
Blockin' out the scenery  
Breakin' my mind  
Do this, don't do that  
Can't you read the sign?  
Sign, sign

Some professionals claim you shouldn't chew a piece of gum for more than 15 minutes at a time. The average length of a college football game last 3 hours and 22 minutes. Let's do some math!

3 hours and 22 minutes = 202 minutes.

Halftime is 20 minutes, and assuming he talks during it he probably takes the gum out. It's respectful. So let's go with 182 minutes.

182 minutes = 12.133 pieces of gum a game. Knowing Kirk he's a Wrigley's Doublemint man. Cant beat $1.38 a pack! Gives him a nice little boost for the game. 15 sticks cone in a pack, so he chews 80.89% of a pack of gum per game. Probably has the last 19.11% throughout the rest of the week. Gum isn't free!

He is currently coaching his 347th game as a Head Coach meaning he has chewed 4210.15 pieces of gum. Let's round up to 4211 pieces, to make 280.73 packs for a grand total of $387.42!

But hold up now hot shot, he hasn't only coached at Iowa! With his time at UMass, Worcester Academy, his first stint at Iowa, and his time in the NFL, he coached on the sidelines at various of positions for an additional 226 games! 6 seasons were in the NFL were the average is 3 hours and 12 minutes minus 12 halftime, making it 3 hours of gum chewing for 12 pieces a game.

477 NCAA Games @ 12.133 Pieces = **5,788 Pieces**

96 NFL Games @ 12 pieces = **1,152 Pieces**

6,940 Pieces of Gum / 15 = **462.67 Packs of Wrigley Doublemint 15 Sticks*&

- They pick a point spread between the teams that gets them 50/50 bet spreads.

- The point differential between the teams is the spread.


Michigan was -21.5 point spread in the game, that’s what it took to get half the bets on Iowa and half the bets on Michigan.

Michigan is winning by more than the spread so they covered the spread.


Over-under applies to many things, but it’s usually a combined point total between both teams.  

If more points are scored than the combined total the over hits, if less than the under hits.

The over under was 35.5.  This is looking like an under.

What’s fun, is you can combined the over under and the spread to get to the projected final score.  

The over under in this game was 35.5, and the spread was 21.5 so the implied final score was Michigan 28-7 Michigan.  

They point a half point on the spread to make people go over or under it.",0,kbrx9dj,t3_189go15,t1_kbrx9dj,t1_kbrvcy7,/r/CFB/comments/189go15/game_thread_iowa_vs_michigan_800_pm_et/kbrx9dj/,2,2,1.14,1.14,0.57,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['michigan', 'grandvalleystate']"

1. Fox fucking sucks, I saw more ad time than game time. The ads completely derail the game and we've missed crucial moments as a result.

2. The officiating was utter dog shit. I have never seen an incomplete call turned into a fumble call when the recovery was after the ball had been blown dead, and a play review not even have an announcement of the result.

3. The commentators would not shut the fuck up.

4. We all knew Iowa was never going to win, but I was at least expecting Iowa to get into FG range for a couple of field goals.

5. Brian Ferentz should be left in Indy and be forced to take a Greyhound back. Michigan didn't even need to steal signs when BF has a playbook that's only 3 pages. Actually, I genuinely think Kirk should be ditched as well.

6. I am glad BIG10 is getting rid of their divisions.

7. As always, even with the over/under set laughably low, the under is a sure bet.

8. I sure hope everyone in that bar in Cedar Rapids are alright.",0,kbryre1,t3_189go15,t1_kbryre1,t3_189go15,/r/CFB/comments/189go15/game_thread_iowa_vs_michigan_800_pm_et/kbryre1/,26,26,4.15,1.55,1.55,1.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,[]

You were one of the few good, non-dickish, Michigan fans I've talked to this week. Honestly, that fumble call & recovery was complete crap and when it happened against Michigan later, same rules didn't apply. I don't think Iowa was going to win, but that is 10 points on the board that wouldn't be there. No turnover leading to an immediate Michigan TD. Kirk wouldn't go for it on 4th and 1 at the end of the 3rd if they were only down 10. So, no short field to get another easy score with a FG. If it stayed a 10 point game, there would likely be less garbage time scores as well because Iowa wouldn't have started going for it on 4th down so early in the 4th either. It just isn't Kirk's gameplay style. This game could very well have ended 10-0 or max 16-0 based on the fact Michigan really wasn't moving the ball that well on Iowa's defense. 

To put into perspective, Michigan's efficient/experienced/talented offense was held to 213 yards total yards by Iowa's defense.
