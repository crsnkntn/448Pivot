I have responded to everything you have said. You have not. You have just attempted to hand wave it away because it doesn't suit your narrative. You cannot win any form of discourse if you don't actually address any of your opponents points. Your entire point of view is framed in a false sense of superiority. You continue pretending that OU was some juggernaut this year, when that is just patently false.

There are multiple flaws with your argument. 

1. OU didn't have to play KSU this year. OSU did. OSU beat KSU this year. OU likely loses that game.
2. Texas improved significantly from the RRS. OU never played that well again. It was, without question, the flukiest win in the conference this season.
3. During the middle of the season, OSU was the best team in the Big 12. Texas struggled to put away Houston and KSU. OU continued to squeak by bad teams and then lost to KU's backup QB. OSU went on a 5 game winning streak fueled by its running game and defense. During this win streak, OSU beat KSU, KU, UC, WVU and OU. That was the best run any team put together during conference play. That's not up for debate.
4. OU was an average team this year. They ran into the Big 12's hottest team at that point of the season and they lost. OSU proceeded to struggle as we lost our top 4 WRs and 3 of our starting OL. Despite this, they still won 2 of the last 3 games. By the way, I seem to recall OU struggling just as heavily against BYU.

There is no asterisk. There was no fluke. The refs did not change the outcome of the game. You don't get to pick and choose what mistakes of the refs get counted and what do not. The refs were heavily biased in OU's favor outside of one call. There is no way that a facemask hold where Nicholas Martin's head gets jerked body while his body continues moving forward on a 67 yard TD run should be missed. It is even more egregious than the missed DPI call. I am literally saying swap out the DPI call for a touchdown while the refs call any of the THREE missed holdings on that run play. 

You sit here and say that fans have to accept that calls go both ways, yet you refuse to accept that the calls did go both ways. It all evened out in the wash. You're arguing against yourself. Either we take out the 67 yard TD or we take out the missed DPI. Your choice. You are the one cherry picking which selective ref mistakes should be called and which shouldn't be. I am okay saying we let it be even. If we take away an egregious mistake that benefited OSU, then we take away an egregious mistake that benefited OU. 1 for 1.

It's not a fact. You're generalizing the opinion of millions of people, most of whom disagree. Just because YOU feel personally slighted does not mean your opinion is reflected in the general population. Once again, you continue to flaunt fake stats and push your opinion as a fact. Both are wrong. State an actual, true fact or give up. You have yet to do anything to persuade anyone. OU lost to a better team.

Refs missed calls throughout the whole game right? Or do you think the 2 calls you are referring to were the only other missed calls? 

After missing some calls on both sides most of which are debatable they proceeded to miss the biggest call of the game that dictated the ending hence the big 12‚Äôs apology which is fact not opinion right? This is what leads to an asterisk because it is acknowledged it directly affected the outcome. That‚Äôs not just OU fans opinions but the accepted reality of when refs and conferences acknowledge missed pivotal calls. 

My argument is that OU was clearly better and should‚Äôve won despite that; the fact it came down to that missed call is because we didn‚Äôt play up to
our potential and OSU to their credit did. This means OU is clearly the better team and now with the championship done has the better season. 

You argue there should be no asterisk because of missed calls on OU earlier in the game. This ignores the other missed calls throughout the game and doesn‚Äôt account for the impact of the calls hence why the big 12 didn‚Äôt release apologies for ANY of the calls you are referring to. So I‚Äôve acknowledged and disproved your first argument with facts.

Secondly you say it‚Äôs not a fluke or an asterisk that OSU proved they were better which by that logic means South Alabama and and UCF proved they were better then OSU and that OU is better than Texas because they won one time head to head. This is a dumb argument that just because you beat a team doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you are better; certainly it‚Äôs a factor but you have to take into account everything. This is why no one is claiming UCF or Southern Alabama are better then OSU or that OSU is better then OU.

I have now broken down for you every argument you have made since you lacked the ability to do so yourself. Now without saying I just refuse to take your OPINIONS into account try to disprove mine with facts. OU is better than OSU that is based on the entire season and current overall consensus of both teams current ability, and finally the OSU win over OU has an asterisk based on the missed call that is acknowledged by the big 12 and reffing crew.",0,kbrxbwp,t3_1896p8u,t1_kbrxbwp,t1_kbrvuab,/r/CFB/comments/1896p8u/game_thread_texas_vs_oklahoma_state_1200_pm_et/kbrxbwp/,1,1,3.87,1.94,1.21,0.0,1.21,0.0,1.21,0.0,"['oklahoma', 'clemson']"
