* First of all, the number of points. 50 should be an over / under, not an amount of points any respectable team should expect to score or allow to be scored. 

* Smartly, it seems like LSU allowed Ole Miss to score from the 12 with about a minute left, which makes sense since they could have ran out the clock and kicked the FG to win it. 

* After that, ole miss immediately allows 40 yards on a short crosser on the subsequent drive. Bruh. 

* Next, LSU hits a defender in the chest but he drops it, because no one can play fucking defense. 

* LSU then calls a QB draw with like 30 seconds left, which somehow winds up being a positive play because of a horsecollar

* They immediately give 10 of those yards back due to false starts (couldn't be me against mn last year, no way) 

* miss the final attempt, no notes.
