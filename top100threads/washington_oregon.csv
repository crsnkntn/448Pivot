2. Expect better everywhere 
3. Expect better from players. 
4. Expect better with refs

We can still fix shit. So can other teams. But it is pointless if the refs still fuck up calls and affect games. If they can’t improve; fire them. 

You got it? Or do I have to explain it more? 

You seem to have this misunderstanding that one can “just get better” and ignore the refs fucking up; and yet reality and facts suggest that isn’t the case when it comes to football. It’s like the weird myth of “just hard work will solve things”. Hard work and bettering yourself only goes so far before you have to acknowledge the other factors that influence things (see;; bad ref calls) or push back. 

But you do you.",0,k4x351o,t3_177vtsq,t1_k4x351o,t1_k4wvw1y,/r/CFB/comments/177vtsq/game_thread_oregon_washington_330_pm_et/k4x351o/,0,0,4.11,1.37,0.68,0.0,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['oregon', 'southernoregon']"

Penix was under duress the entire night. Their line couldn’t block anyone. Herbstreit kept pointing it out. That line hadn’t dealt with an nfl style defensive line all year. They finally did and struggled to move the ball. Sure Penix missed 2 open receivers, but Michigan had their fair share of drops that could have resulted in more points. Michigan was easily a 14 point better team than Washington. I never had a doubt at any point in the game that Michigan would win. Maybe not a 21 point better team, but my point still stands. It will be very interesting to see how they adjust coming to the big 10. Because Washington and Oregon won’t throw for 400 yards every game anymore.
