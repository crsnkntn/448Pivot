I know DT is the hardest position to find elite talent, but if you want to be elite that is what they need. They knew they had to replace Mustipher, who was good, but not great, and they didn't.  Why could they not get some talented NT over 300lbs during the off-season?  They knew that was their big need for this year.  They didn't even get a top DT recruit.  Open up the NIL and get a real nose tackle if you want to get to the playoffs.

I thought Allar looked outstanding.  Not just the throws, which everyone knew he had the arm for.  It was the adjustments, reacting during plays, improvising, even when he threw it away.  For his first start, and against P5 competition, that's pretty impressive.  He looks like the best QB at PSU since Kerry Collins in the 90s and Blackledge himself in the 80s.

Define Rivalry. 

Penn st wont schedule WVU for another 30 years so its not going to have chance to really shine. 

There is a lot of overlap between the Penn st and WVU fan base, especially in the western part of the state, and you saw a lot of intermingling at tailgates, so no matter what penn st fans say this game means more than any b1G game outside OSU. I was talking to penn st fans and they said we travelled about as well as OSU, and Better than Maryland and Rutgers.

I was at the Pitt WVU game last year, and that game had a lot of Spite, and both fan bases were actively trying to be belligerent and assholes to each other. this penn st game had none of that. so if spite defines a rivalry then this game did not have it, but idk how it could have spite considering wvu hasnt won in state college since 1954. (doesnt help that penn st dodged Pat white, geno smith, will grier, and rasheed marshall). compared to the wvu maryland or wvu vt rivalry, it seemed to be about the same, except We havnt played VT much recently, and Maryland fans dont care about football so its about the same.

the Biggest Reason why this wont be considered a rivalry, is penn st fans are to arrogant to admit that it is",0,jz4dk8f,t3_168fx8i,t1_jz4dk8f,t1_jywalk6,/r/CFB/comments/168fx8i/game_thread_west_virginia_penn_state_730_pm_et/jz4dk8f/,7,7,2.54,2.12,1.69,0.0,1.69,0.0,1.69,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"
