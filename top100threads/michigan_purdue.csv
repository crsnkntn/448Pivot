There's a very quick and easy explanation for that.

When Jim Harbaugh got to Michigan, he lost his very first game as a head coach to Utah. I knew on the spot that he was not the guy.

But then he won 5 straight games, and I though ""Huh, maybe he isn't so bad"".

But then we had trouble with the snap, and I though ""Fire Harbaugh"".

But then he won 4 straight, and I though ""Maybe that was a little harsh.""

But then we lost to Ohio State and I though ""Screw Harbaugh I hate him.""

But then we beat the shit out of Florida in the Citrus Bowl and I thought ""Ok, maybe next year.""

Then we won 9 straight and I said ""Harbaugh is the greatest coach in Michigan history. Move over, Bo.""

But then we lost at Iowa and I said, ""Harbaugh is an abject failure.""

But then we beat Indiana and I said, ""Ok Harbaugh, let's see if you can beat Ohio State."" He couldn't. Fuck him. And then he couldn't even beat FSU in a Bowl game. Total embarrassment.

2017 rolled around and I was over Harbaugh. Until he beat Florida, and then won 3 more games, and I said, ""Harbaugh is the greatest.""

But then we lost to MSU. Harbaugh has to go, now.

But then he beat Indiana. And I said, ""Ok, maybe one more game."" That one game was a loss to Penn State. I'm so fucking sick of Harbaugh at this point.

But then he won 3 games, and I decided to curb my rage. That was a mistake apparently, because he then had losses to Wisconsin and Ohio State, followed by losing to a bunch of dicks in a bowl game. God, fucking Harbaugh. Fucking motherfucking FUCCCK!!!

Then that stupid asshole lost to Notre Dame to start the 2018 season. Clearly the worst coach ever. Not just the worst coach in Michigan History, but the worst coach anywhere, at any time, ever.

But then Harbaugh fired off 5 straight wins before heading into a tough stretch of multiple ranked matchups. I though ""Watch this, this stupid fucker is going to lose them all."" He didn't, he won them all, then beat Rutgers and Maryland to make 10 straight wins.

Harbaugh is elite. Make him coach for life.

And then he lost to Ohio State. FUCK YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. Losing to Florida in that bowl game was just the cherry on top of my pure hatred of this man.

After that, I was unsurprised when he had an unimpressive game against Middle Tennessee and had to go to 2OT against Army before getting shitstomped in Camp Randall. Typical Harbaugh.

But then he won 3 straight, including beating a ranked Iowa team 10-3. Hmm. Ok Harbaugh. Maybe you aren't so bad.

Fuck that, yes you are, because then you lost to fucking Penn State in a whiteout, you asshole.

BUT THEN YOU FOLLOWED IT UP WITH THE GREATEST WIN IN A DECADE - BEATING THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF A TOP 10 NOTRE DAME. 45-14 BITCHES!!!! HARBAUGH IS BACK!!!!!

And then you won 3 more after that including beating MSU? Let's fucking GOOOOOOOOO!!!

But then you lost again to Ohio State and then had a bowl loss to Albama? When the fuck are we getting rid of this guy?

And then 2020 happened. Started out the year with a beatdown of ranked Minnesota and I said ""Joe Milton is the new Cam Newton."" He was not.

Then we stunk it up. After losing to MSU, Wisconsin, and fucking INDIANA, Harbaugh needed 3OTs just to beat our rival Rutgers. That's when I knew Harbaugh needed gone for sure. I was glad when the rest of the season got cancelled.

Going into 2021 I was pissed when Harbaugh was still in Michigan. Rolling over WMU did nothing to change that, nor did beating Washington, since they had just lost to an FCS school.

But after a win over Northern Illinois and getting revenge on Rocky Lombardi, then beating our rival Rutgers, I said ""Extend Harbaugh forever. He's the greatest."" Wins over Wisconsin, Northwestern, and Nebraska only served to bolster that. Harbaugh is the greatest. Michigan is winning it all. Nothing could stop us.

And then MSU stopped us. Fucking Harbaugh. Should have been fired years ago.

I was unimpressed by beating Indiana after that. I was also unimpressed by beating Penn State and Maryland. At this point my mind was made up. Literally nothing can change my mind about this man. Not even if he were to somehow beat Ohio St... **WHAT THE FUCK WE BEAT OHIO STATE!?!?!?!? I CAN'T BREATE I CAN'T BREATHE OMG I'M GONNA CRY. THIS IS THE GREATEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED IM HYPERVENTILATING.**

**AND THEN WE BEAT IOWA IN THE B1G CG?? MICHIGAN IS B1G CHAMPS??? WE'RE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS?? IS THIS A DISNEY MOVIE??? I FUCKING LOVE HARBAUGH KEEP HIM FOREVER.""**

But then we lost to Georgia in the Playoffs. Christ Harbaugh sucks. I was so pissed when he didn't go to the NFL. 2022 rolled around and he started it off by beating up on a bunch of cupcakes. Whatever. And then he freaking almost lost to **Maryland!** FIRE THIS DUDE YESTERDAY! Nothing short of a total beatdown against Penn State could make up for that! And ... that's what happened. Oh. AND THEN 3 MORE BEATDOWNS INCLUDING AGAINST SPARTY??? EXTEND HARBAUGH!

But then you nearly lost to fucking Illinois. Jesus Christ you are pathetic. I don't even give a shit what you do in **HOLY FUCK WE BEAT OHIO STATE IN COLUMBUS. AND THEN WE WON THE BIG TEN CHAMPIONSHIP AGAIN! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! BUILD HARBAUGH A FUCKING STATUE AND GIVE HIM THE FUCKING KEYS TO THE**... what the fuck? You lost to TCU? Get fucked Harbaugh.

And now you're just whipping unranked opponents and turns out that Michigan has been stealing signs. I'm so fucking sick of Jim Harbaugh.",0,k7uxa59,t3_17nxe0b,t1_k7uxa59,t3_17nxe0b,/r/CFB/comments/17nxe0b/game_thread_purdue_michigan_730_pm_et/k7uxa59/,7,7,2.98,5.96,1.49,0.2,1.09,0.0,0.5,0.1,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"

There's a very quick and easy explanation for that.

When Jim Harbaugh got to Michigan, he lost his very first game as a head coach to Utah. I knew on the spot that he was not the guy.

But then he won 5 straight games, and I though ""Huh, maybe he isn't so bad"".

But then we had trouble with the snap, and I though ""Fire Harbaugh"".

But then he won 4 straight, and I though ""Maybe that was a little harsh.""

But then we lost to Ohio State and I though ""Screw Harbaugh I hate him.""

But then we beat the shit out of Florida in the Citrus Bowl and I thought ""Ok, maybe next year.""

Then we won 9 straight and I said ""Harbaugh is the greatest coach in Michigan history. Move over, Bo.""

But then we lost at Iowa and I said, ""Harbaugh is an abject failure.""

But then we beat Indiana and I said, ""Ok Harbaugh, let's see if you can beat Ohio State."" He couldn't. Fuck him. And then he couldn't even beat FSU in a Bowl game. Total embarrassment.

2017 rolled around and I was over Harbaugh. Until he beat Florida, and then won 3 more games, and I said, ""Harbaugh is the greatest.""

But then we lost to MSU. Harbaugh has to go, now.

But then he beat Indiana. And I said, ""Ok, maybe one more game."" That one game was a loss to Penn State. I'm so fucking sick of Harbaugh at this point.

But then he won 3 games, and I decided to curb my rage. That was a mistake apparently, because he then had losses to Wisconsin and Ohio State, followed by losing to a bunch of dicks in a bowl game. God, fucking Harbaugh. Fucking motherfucking FUCCCK!!!

Then that stupid asshole lost to Notre Dame to start the 2018 season. Clearly the worst coach ever. Not just the worst coach in Michigan History, but the worst coach anywhere, at any time, ever.

But then Harbaugh fired off 5 straight wins before heading into a tough stretch of multiple ranked matchups. I though ""Watch this, this stupid fucker is going to lose them all."" He didn't, he won them all, then beat Rutgers and Maryland to make 10 straight wins.

Harbaugh is elite. Make him coach for life.

And then he lost to Ohio State. FUCK YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. Losing to Florida in that bowl game was just the cherry on top of my pure hatred of this man.

After that, I was unsurprised when he had an unimpressive game against Middle Tennessee and had to go to 2OT against Army before getting shitstomped in Camp Randall. Typical Harbaugh.

But then he won 3 straight, including beating a ranked Iowa team 10-3. Hmm. Ok Harbaugh. Maybe you aren't so bad.

Fuck that, yes you are, because then you lost to fucking Penn State in a whiteout, you asshole.

BUT THEN YOU FOLLOWED IT UP WITH THE GREATEST WIN IN A DECADE - BEATING THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF A TOP 10 NOTRE DAME. 45-14 BITCHES!!!! HARBAUGH IS BACK!!!!!

And then you won 3 more after that including beating MSU? Let's fucking GOOOOOOOOO!!!

But then you lost again to Ohio State and then had a bowl loss to Albama? When the fuck are we getting rid of this guy?

And then 2020 happened. Started out the year with a beatdown of ranked Minnesota and I said ""Joe Milton is the new Cam Newton."" He was not.

Then we stunk it up. After losing to MSU, Wisconsin, and fucking INDIANA, Harbaugh needed 3OTs just to beat our rival Rutgers. That's when I knew Harbaugh needed gone for sure. I was glad when the rest of the season got cancelled.

Going into 2021 I was pissed when Harbaugh was still in Michigan. Rolling over WMU did nothing to change that, nor did beating Washington, since they had just lost to an FCS school.

But after a win over Northern Illinois and getting revenge on Rocky Lombardi, then beating our rival Rutgers, I said ""Extend Harbaugh forever. He's the greatest."" Wins over Wisconsin, Northwestern, and Nebraska only served to bolster that. Harbaugh is the greatest. Michigan is winning it all. Nothing could stop us.

And then MSU stopped us. Fucking Harbaugh. Should have been fired years ago.

I was unimpressed by beating Indiana after that. I was also unimpressed by beating Penn State and Maryland. At this point my mind was made up. Literally nothing can change my mind about this man. Not even if he were to somehow beat Ohio St... **WHAT THE FUCK WE BEAT OHIO STATE!?!?!?!? I CAN'T BREATE I CAN'T BREATHE OMG I'M GONNA CRY. THIS IS THE GREATEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED IM HYPERVENTILATING.**

**AND THEN WE BEAT IOWA IN THE B1G CG?? MICHIGAN IS B1G CHAMPS??? WE'RE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS?? IS THIS A DISNEY MOVIE??? I FUCKING LOVE HARBAUGH KEEP HIM FOREVER.""**

But then we lost to Georgia in the Playoffs. Christ Harbaugh sucks. I was so pissed when he didn't go to the NFL. 2022 rolled around and he started it off by beating up on a bunch of cupcakes. Whatever. And then he freaking almost lost to **Maryland!** FIRE THIS DUDE YESTERDAY! Nothing short of a total beatdown against Penn State could make up for that! And ... that's what happened. Oh. AND THEN 3 MORE BEATDOWNS INCLUDING AGAINST SPARTY??? EXTEND HARBAUGH!

But then you nearly lost to fucking Illinois. Jesus Christ you are pathetic. I don't even give a shit what you do in **HOLY FUCK WE BEAT OHIO STATE IN COLUMBUS. AND THEN WE WON THE BIG TEN CHAMPIONSHIP AGAIN! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! BUILD HARBAUGH A FUCKING STATUE AND GIVE HIM THE FUCKING KEYS TO THE**... what the fuck? You lost to TCU? Get fucked Harbaugh.

And now you're just whipping unranked opponents and turns out that Michigan has been stealing signs. I'm so fucking sick of Jim Harbaugh.",0,k7uxa59,t3_17nxe0b,t1_k7uxa59,t3_17nxe0b,/r/CFB/comments/17nxe0b/game_thread_purdue_michigan_730_pm_et/k7uxa59/,7,7,2.98,5.96,1.49,0.2,1.09,0.0,0.5,0.1,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"

The NCAA has a punishment for this. It's the lowest level of punishment as sign stealing was determined by the NCAA to give a ""minimal advantage"" which is why they suggested getting rid of the rule in 2021.

They were akin to the Montagues and Capulets of their time, representing the University of Michigan and The Ohio State University, respectively.

Jim Harbaugh, the passionate, fiery leader from Michigan, was known for his unwavering determination and old-school tactics. On the other side stood Ryan Day, the young, innovative strategist from Ohio State, whose modern approach to the game captured the hearts of many.

Their rivalry was legendary, etched into the annals of college football history. But behind the scenes, away from the fierce competition and glaring media spotlights, an unexpected narrative was unraveling.

It all began on a rainy evening at a coaching seminar where both Jim and Ryan found themselves, coincidentally, sitting next to each other. A shared enthusiasm for the game bridged the initial awkwardness, sparking conversations that extended beyond X's and O's. Over time, what started as respectful admiration for each other's coaching prowess transformed into something deeper.

Jim, with his rugged determination and an infectious enthusiasm for the sport, found himself drawn to Ryan's fresh ideas and innovative strategies. Meanwhile, Ryan was captivated by Jim's unwavering commitment and wealth of experience.

Their love story bloomed in secret, concealed from the prying eyes of the football world. Furtive meetings in obscure coffee shops and clandestine dinners in secluded restaurants allowed their affection to blossom. In these stolen moments, they found solace in each other's company, away from the animosity of their professional lives.

Their love, however, was a forbidden fruit, a hidden affair that they knew could never be accepted openly in the fiercely divided world of college football. They were torn between their duties to their respective teams and the longing in their hearts.

As fate would have it, during a pivotal game between their two teams, a game that could potentially decide the championship, the emotions they harbored for each other could no longer be contained. In a moment of vulnerability, amidst the chaos of the game, their eyes met across the field, and the unspoken language of love resonated between them.

It was a game where the intensity of the rivalry reached its peak, yet in the midst of the battle, they found a moment to come together, if only for a fleeting instant. In that fleeting moment, the world around them seemed to fade, and for a heartbeat, they were just two souls bound by an unbreakable affection.

Their love story remained a secret, buried under the weight of their responsibilities. The rivalry persisted, and life went on as usual in the world of college football. But in their hearts, the memories of stolen moments and unspoken words remained, etched as an indelible part of their lives, hidden away from the tumultuous world they knew.",0,k7vmt36,t3_17nxe0b,t1_k7vmt36,t3_17nxe0b,/r/CFB/comments/17nxe0b/game_thread_purdue_michigan_730_pm_et/k7vmt36/,11,11,3.76,1.04,2.92,1.88,0.63,0.0,0.63,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"

Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Jim Harbaugh shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big Jim fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Jim was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget.

Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Jim Harbaugh shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big Jim fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Jim was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Jim Harbaugh and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.",0,k7vnar1,t3_17nxe0b,t1_k7vnar1,t3_17nxe0b,/r/CFB/comments/17nxe0b/game_thread_purdue_michigan_730_pm_et/k7vnar1/,5,5,6.35,1.0,3.68,2.68,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"
