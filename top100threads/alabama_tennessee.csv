A valid or invalid fair catch signal deprives the receiving team of the opportunity to advance the ball. The ball is declared dead at the spot of the catch or recovery or at the spot of the signal if the catch precedes the signal

Valid Signal

ARTICLE 2.

A valid signal is a signal given by a player of Team B who has obviously signaled his intention by extending one hand only clearly above his head and waving that hand from side to side of his body more than once.


Since the player who waved the catch wasn't one who intended to catch the ball, the signal was invalid, but still prevents the receiving team from making forward progress.
