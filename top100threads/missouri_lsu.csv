My kU neighbor was smacking a Wiffle ball against his garage wall, paddle in hand. But what caught my eye was the jar of pickles sitting beside him on a pedestal, as if it were a trophy.

""What in the hell are you doing?"" I asked, already regretting the question.

""Ah, this is REAL Pickleball,"" he beamed, like he'd discovered fire. ""You see, you gotta keep a pickle clenched between your cheeks. Drop the pickle, lose your points!""

""And you're playing against...the wall?""

""The wall never complains, never judges,"" he said. My kU neighbor then picked up a pickle, gave it an exaggerated, almost sensual lick for ""extra grip,"" and skillfully wedged it, well, into place. He resumed playing. The pickle, somehow, stayed put.

In a matter of minutes, he crowned himself the victor, doing a peculiar waddle-walk victory lap around his revered jar of pickles. My kU neighbor then carefully removed the ""game-used"" pickle, reverently placed it back in its jar, and returned the jar to a place of honor in his fridge.

As he tidied up, he unveiled a weathered notebook labeled 'Revolutionary Game Ideas.'

""Next on the agenda, Cornhole!"" my kU neighbor proclaimed, vigorously rubbing an ear of corn between his palms until it reached—and I quote—""just the right temperature.""",0,k3v4nyi,t3_1728e9y,t1_k3v4nyi,t3_1728e9y,/r/CFB/comments/1728e9y/game_thread_lsu_missouri_1200_pm_et/k3v4nyi/,48,48,3.46,0.87,0.43,0.0,0.43,0.0,0.0,0.43,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"
