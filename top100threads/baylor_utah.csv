The flip side is that we’ve got four new starters, and our OL coach took a week or two off at the end of fall camp to deal with the death of a parent. The OC stepped in to coach the OL while the other coach is taking time to process his grief, which is understandable, but apparently the OC has a much more aggressive, old-school approach as a position coach, and the OLs were commenting in their media appearance that it was a bit of a whiplash.

BU’s historical mean. We weren’t phenomenal in the SWC, but we were approximately tied with TAMU for third-best win rate in the SWC (behind UT and Arkansas).

We got a school president in the mid-90s who was previously the seminary’s chair, and he decided that Baylor’s athletics were distracting from the “Christian mission” at the core of the Christian university identity, so he started killing athletics by a thousand small budget cuts.

The big problem was that, even after that president was ousted after repeated faculty votes of no confidence, there wasn’t a sufficient booster corps to help rebuild football until Ken Starr rolled in and rebuilt those relationships. The old president redirected a lot of those boosters’ attentions to the seminary, which most of them didn’t care much about, but he still got an absolutely opulent building built for the seminary.",0,jztwrky,t3_16e7uxq,t1_jztwrky,t1_jztp284,/r/CFB/comments/16e7uxq/game_thread_utah_baylor_1200_pm_et/jztwrky/,1,1,3.27,0.65,1.31,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['baylor', 'texasam']"

Utah almost lost that game several times - the center holding a DB after the RB had already gotten a game sealing first down, taking the touchdown rather than going down at the 1, and then the coverage bust and uncalled DPI at the end of the game.

But don't take my word for it - Why would Baylor let Utah score if they felt like their best course of action was blocking the field goal attempt? They wouldn't.
