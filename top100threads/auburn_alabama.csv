To begin with, the critical point of focus is the positioning of the receiver's feet in relation to the boundary lines. If both of the receiver's feet make contact with the playing field before any other part of his body, and he maintains possession of the ball, there is a strong likelihood that the catch is deemed in bounds.

Conversely, if even one foot is determined to have landed out of bounds, it could result in the pass being considered incomplete. This assessment often requires a meticulous review by officials, who may consult video replays to ascertain the precise moment of contact between the receiver's feet and the playing surface.

Furthermore, the concept of maintaining possession throughout the completion of the catch adds another layer of complexity. The receiver must exhibit control over the ball, ensuring that it does not jostle or move substantially during the process of securing the catch. This requirement aims to eliminate ambiguity and establish a clear standard for what constitutes a completed catch.

In some instances, the speed and intensity of the play may lead to debates regarding whether the receiver had sufficient time to establish control before potentially stepping out of bounds. This introduces an element of subjectivity to the decision-making process, as officials must interpret the sequence of events within the context of the game's dynamic nature.

Additionally, external factors such as sideline constraints and defender influence may impact the receiver's ability to maintain possession in bounds. Defensive pressure or contact can disrupt the receiver's balance, potentially influencing the outcome of the catch. The officials must carefully consider these factors when making a determination.

Ultimately, the decision of whether an Alabama wide receiver caught a pass in bounds is a nuanced and intricate evaluation that necessitates a comprehensive examination of multiple variables. The interplay between foot placement, ball control, and external influences culminates in a judgment call by the officiating crew, whose aim is to uphold the integrity of the game and ensure a fair and accurate representation of each play.",0,karij47,t3_183rfxa,t1_karij47,t3_183rfxa,/r/CFB/comments/183rfxa/game_thread_alabama_auburn_330_pm_et/karij47/,4,4,1.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,['clemson']

For better or for worse, college football is a big business.  You need to have a head coach that can field a competitive team regularly.  I will honestly say that with Freeze as a HC I do think this team will be one of the top teams in the conferece within a few years.  He'll keep Auburn competitive with the likes of Texas and Oklahoma.  Provided, of course, he keeps his nose clean.  It's his second chance of sorts.

The defensive back just failed to do his job. He allowed the WR to push off when he should have been fighting back to jam the WR into the side line. The corner who initially lined up on the WR (20 yards off) allowed the receiver to get behind him, and then he straight up lost him in the fray. I'm not terribly sure that rushing two was a good idea, but to be fair the defense had mainly been geared up to stop the run all night long. They were asked to work out of a scheme that they hadn't worked in all night long. 
We also have to remember that coach Freeze didn't drop the goddamn fair catch punt either. I feel bad for that kid that dropped that. He catches that punt, and auburn runs the ball to kill the clock.
