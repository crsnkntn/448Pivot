1) Our defense looks solid. Proud of their fight. They’ve done everything asked of them today.

2) The offense has been a disaster, however. Hard to fairly judge them considering Ohio State is one of the best teams in the country, but nonetheless 3 points through 55 minutes of football is uhh… not good.

3) Ohio State is very good, don’t get me wrong – but considering the quality (or lack thereof) of their opponent, they haven’t looked good offensively today, especially up front. I have my doubts about their ability to compete for a national title unless the O-line and QB play improves considerably; that said, there’s a lot more football left this season so this can certainly change.

All in all, I’m pleased with our fight today, but bummed by the inability to do just about anything offensively.
