so yeah, people are going to laugh at the end of the season when they look back at all the current hype and narrative around Deion. i mean, Colorado will be lucky to make the Idaho Potato Bowl.",0,k0w2foi,t3_16keh7j,t1_k0w2foi,t3_16keh7j,/r/CFB/comments/16keh7j/game_thread_south_carolina_georgia_330_pm_et/k0w2foi/,3,3,3.28,2.46,3.28,2.46,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['olemiss', 'kansas']"

Jury Duty is absolutely necessary


Yes it's boring. Yes it sucks to be stuck there. 

But it is the most necessary part of our justice system. If no one participated on Juries then we could not have the justice system we have. It's much harder to convince 12 people of a person's guilt than it is to convince 1. 

And with the standard for guilt in Felony cases being a Unanimous jury, and you're supposed to on a jury look for beyond a reasonable doubt as your standard. It means hopefully fewer wrongful convictions. 

If that doesn't convince you to go to Jury duty enthusiastically. Pretend you were falsely accused and you got a bunch of apathetic jurors who don't really give a shit about the evidence or the case.
