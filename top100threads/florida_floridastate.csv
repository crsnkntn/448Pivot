1. When in question whether an unsportsmanlike act is a live-ball or deadball foul, it is a dead-ball foul.
2. Do not be overly technical in applying Rule 9-2-1.
3. Allow for brief, spontaneous, emotional reactions at the end of a play.
4. Beyond the brief, spontaneous bursts of energy, officials should flag
those acts that are clearly prolonged, self-congratulatory, and that make a
mockery of the game.
5. A list of specifically prohibited acts is in Rule 9-2-1-a-1 (a) thru (k).
That list is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. All agree that
when those acts are clearly intended to taunt or demean, they should be
penalized.

It was a 3rd down play and he was like 2 yards away, still upright. The defenders had to go full speed at him or it’s a first down, essentially game over. They were already full speed making a tackling motion when he started the slide. Laws of physics don’t allow a person going full speed to suddenly not be moving at all in 0.000000003 seconds. In slow motion it looked like the slide started before they started to tackle, but in real time it’s obvious they couldn’t have stopped.

The fact that they were that low meant they were reacting to him sliding. The entire point of that rule is that they want defensive players to react by pulling away from a tackle then the QB slides, not lean into it. 

It’s illegal for a QB to fake a slide. So stay high. If they fake the slide, you get them. If they actually slide, you soar over them.

I’m going into medicine, man. I fully understand and the impact concussions can have and appreciate the strives the game has made for player safety, but it is unfair to place the onus entirely on the defender in that situation. If he slides even a yard earlier, contact is probably minimized. If he keeps running like he was, those kids make a clean hit on the ball carrier.

Doing our best to remove game day emotion from it. 

I find merit to the argument that in practice the QB slide rule leads to more danger/injury to QBs. 

However, the rule is on the rule books and it is there. It specifically puts the responsibility on the defenders to play in a way to reduce the risk of injury to the QB. That includes turning a legal tackle move into an illegal one within the window that they cannot change. So they are limited on what kind of tackle they can initiate against a QB. 

It’s a handicap on the defenders. It’s there on purpose. A part of the point is to prevent defenders from initiating tackles like the ones today. When defenders make them and the QB slides, yes, the defenders didn’t KNOW the QB would slide when they started the tackle, but it was incumbent on them to not start the motion knowing the QB could slide. 

There have been times that Seminole’s have been flagged for similar tackles that were legal when they started but illegal when they contacted a sliding QB that I’ve equally supported. 

That’s how the rules are written. That’s the game on the field. 

As I said, though, I’m open to the argument that this rule opens a QB up to lore danger due to encouraging them to put themselves into a higher risk of head injury. 

But that’s not the game we are playing today. The tackle today was against the rules. It was incumbent upon the UF defenders to limit their tackle knowing that the QB could slide. They know the rules. They know it was likely that the QB would slide. It makes it harder to be a defender. But those are the rules we all play with.",0,kaso0d5,t3_183w2c9,t1_kaso0d5,t1_kasmii2,/r/CFB/comments/183w2c9/game_thread_florida_state_florida_700_pm_et/kaso0d5/,2,2,1.96,2.94,0.98,0.0,0.65,0.0,0.65,0.0,"['floridastate', 'floridacup']"
