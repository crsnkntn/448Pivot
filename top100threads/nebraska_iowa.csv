You can't just be up there and just doin' targeting like that.

1a. Targeting is when you

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The defender is not allowed to hit the, uh, ball carrier, in a way that targets the ball carrier from, you know, just trying to run the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the defender is going for the tackle, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get you down! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to tackle low and then the runner goes low, you have to still tackle lower. You cannot not hit their head. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, go low at the ball carrier, and then, until you can‚Äôt touch their head.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have your head up here, like this, but then there's targeting you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Target hasn't been in any media in forever. I hope isn‚Äôt typecast as that store with a dog mascot in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, it was in Percy Jackson and the Olympians: the Titans curse too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). ""get in mah bellah"" -- Adam Water, ""The Waterboy."" Haha, classic...

1c-b(3). Okay seriously though.

The firing of Bo was bad but it had to happen both sides were unhappy.

Bo Pelini wasn't this god of coaching He hasn't done too much since he left and isn't even a HC anymore.

But the choices after Bo have been very bad. 

Riley just wasn't a good fit at all. He also wasn't given a real shot. He had a bad first year which is normal then a good 2nd year then was faced with a hard schedule and had a losing season. We canned him despite that for the new Shiny toy.

Scott Frost who was just corrupt there isn't really much else to say. Frost didn't take his job seriously enough because everyone in Nebraska turned the eye to the ole QB from the glory days. But he was acting like a total diva and slept around and was drunk.

Now fast forward to Matt Rhule, I mean what does he have to work with? Scott Frost left this place worse than he got it. Our Oline wasn't coached well but they made good improvements this year but you can only improve so much in an offseason. Our defense did a full 180 and we were left with sub pair QB room. Sure Chubba might be a good QB for our future but Casey Thompson and Haarberrg? Smoothers? I mean that room was awful. Casey was good but he wasn't this great QB either he just benefitted from the fact that he could throw it up to one of the fastest WR's in CFB that year.   
Nebraska is very young on offense and next year will be VERY experienced on defense. Our defense next year will be scary even if White leaves(which I think he won't) and our offense will have a year and maybe a portal transfer.

The question I ask is what does Nebraska do to make upt he mistakes. Matt Rhule was out of CFB for awhile so his first year being a losing one isn't a surprise even vs a bad CFB schedule. What improvements can we see. We've already seen massive ones that I really enjoyed but what else can we see? I'm excited but also nervous and this is a person who 2 hours ago was swearing off football for a year or two.",0,kameffh,t3_182v9ux,t1_kameffh,t1_kamcru2,/r/CFB/comments/182v9ux/game_thread_iowa_nebraska_1200_pm_et/kameffh/,6,6,3.78,4.53,4.03,1.76,2.02,0.5,0.0,0.0,['nebraska']
