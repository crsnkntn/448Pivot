First one went to Idaho for reasons I still can't fathom. Second one went to UPS. Third one actually got into UW and decided to go to Gonzaga, without knowing that it's a Catholic school until he showed up and saw priests walking around during orientation. Fourth went to Central (granted, on a really decent scholarship, but family didn't exactly need it, as is probably obvious). First three all applied to UW (the first 2 didn't get in, honestly not sure if the fourth applied), and all four got into Wazzu. 

The question is: in what world did any of them have a better college experience than they would've in Pullman? Is it just because they were brought up Husky fans?

Maybe. This shit’s really hard to figure out tbh

A 4 way, *i think*, will still result in UW-OSU. Take it with a bunch of salt 

——

Not all four teams (Arizona/wash/both oregons) played each other so we work down the tie breakers. 

Next is record against common opponents. That’s WSU, Stanford, and Utah. Three teams are 3-0 and OSU is 2-1, so OSU drops here. 

Then it’s record against highest ranked common opponents but the three remaining are all 3-0. 

Then it’s strength of conference schedule. For mathematical reasons we can ignore common opponents, so UW is Cal, Oregon, and Ariz, UO is Colo, Cal, and Wash, UA is Colo, UCLA, and UW

That seems to indicate UW comes out on top. Hm okay

So anyway now we have to figure out who’s on top between Oregon, Oregon state, and Arizona. No full H2H, so common opponents. WSU, Stanford, Utah, UW, Colorado. They’re all 4-1. So we go highest ranked common. That’s Washington. OSU is the only one with a win, so they’re now second.",0,k9qkouz,t3_17xw6oo,t1_k9qkouz,t1_k9qg3e1,/r/CFB/comments/17xw6oo/game_thread_colorado_washington_state_1030_pm_et/k9qkouz/,1,1,1.59,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"

There are:

* 120 million in assets 
* 35 million in liabilities 
* 420 million in media revenue to distribute.  
* Pac-12 Network Equipment and Infrastructure

If the Pac-2 get control they are likely to use the media revenue to pay off the liabilities and refill the emergency fund that was emptied to pay Comcast.  So the 10 leaving teams are likely to leave with ~25 million per school instead of 35 million from the media revenue. 

If the Pac-10 get control they are likely to either: 

1. Dissolve the conference, divide up the $120 million, pay off the liabilities from it, and walk away with 42 million each plus whatever the Pac-12 network is sold for.  

2. Vote to leave the liabilities with the conference and divide the assets among all 12 members, leaving the Pac-12 with a negative value as a conference to force the Pac-2 to foot the $35 million bill themselves (but them also getting to keep the Pac-12 Network and brand). Walking away with about $45 million but no rights to the Pac-12 Network.

Either way, the 10 leaving schools would gut the Pac-12 to walk away with 40-something million instead of 20-something million.
