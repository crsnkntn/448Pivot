But honestly you guys, I'm sad yall are leaving. There's a reason it's the civil war. I went to school with so many guys that grew up Ducks and wanted to be engineers and went to corvallis instead of Eugene. Of my ~22 cousins (Irish family) that went to college, about 75% went to either Oregon state or UofO.

This rivalry splits families, there ain't nothing civil about it.
