Started off in typical Wyoming style, then TTU started shooting themselves in the foot and our defense started showing up a bit.

Worried about the QB situation though.  Peasley is clearly not okay, but Svbota is super inexperienced in comparison.  We're playing 5th and 6th stringers at RB, and our receivers and TEs just cannot match tech's speed.

Gonna need some luck and for our defense to not get gassed.  If we can get another TO or two and clean up the punts, we might be able to make it interesting.

I want to say, though, that's I'm a lot more impressed with Polasek's playcalling.  He's still stuck within the confines of Bohl's preferred system, but he's clearly trying new things and clearly not giving up on the passing game.  As abysmal as the offense has still looked at times, it looks worlds better than last year's opener at Illinois.

Just wish we could've seen what would've been with our top two RBs and top WR, and without Peas getting the snot beat out of his head.",0,jyw9zj7,t3_168fxcn,t1_jyw9zj7,t3_168fxcn,/r/CFB/comments/168fxcn/game_thread_texas_tech_wyoming_730_pm_et/jyw9zj7/,5,5,5.06,0.56,0.56,0.0,0.56,0.56,0.0,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"
