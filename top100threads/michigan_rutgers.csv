My whole point is that Rutgers is too... I think you're putting too much weight on the fact that Schiano has done a good job of pulling Rutgers from ""literal worst in FBS"" to ""bad, but has some spunk"". The latter being squarely where I'd slot Nebraska/Minnesota too.

Yes, I've lived in the DMV and have been to Michigan games @Maryland. Crowd won't be hostile but there are more factors to road games than that realistically.

1. **Rutgers vs. West Virginia (2001) - Lost 80-7**: This game holds the dubious distinction of being one of the most lopsided losses in Rutgers history. West Virginia was virtually unstoppable, putting up 80 points against a hapless Rutgers defense. This game was a significant low point for the program and is often cited as an example of their struggles during that era.

2. **Rutgers vs. Louisville (2005) - Lost 56-5**: Coming into the game, Rutgers had some momentum, but Louisville quickly crushed any hopes of a competitive game. The Cardinals dominated in all facets, leaving Rutgers with little to hang its hat on. The loss was particularly demoralizing as it came in the era where Rutgers was trying to establish itself as a legitimate Big East contender.

3. **Rutgers vs. Michigan (2016) - Lost 78-0**: Perhaps one of the most talked-about losses in recent memory, Rutgers was thoroughly outplayed by Michigan in every aspect of the game. The Wolverines scored 11 touchdowns and amassed over 600 yards of offense, while Rutgers only managed 39 total yards. The defeat was emblematic of the struggles the program faced during that period.

4. **Rutgers vs. Cincinnati (2010) - Lost 69-38**: This game was especially tough because it was a Big East conference game, and the Scarlet Knights had hopes of making a strong showing. Instead, they were overwhelmed by Cincinnati's offense, with the Bearcats scoring almost at will. The defense had no answer, and it was a clear indication that the program had some work to do.

5. **Rutgers vs. Notre Dame (2002) - Lost 42-0**: Rutgers entered the game as significant underdogs but hoped to make a respectable showing against a Notre Dame team that was on the rise. However, the Fighting Irish quickly asserted their dominance, shutting out Rutgers entirely. The loss demonstrated the gap between Rutgers and traditional college football powers at that time.",0,k1w0hb1,t3_16q6owk,t1_k1w0hb1,t3_16q6owk,/r/CFB/comments/16q6owk/game_thread_rutgers_michigan_1200_pm_et/k1w0hb1/,5,5,1.53,3.99,1.53,0.92,0.61,0.31,0.0,0.0,"["" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'"", "" '"", ""', 'e'"", "" 'https"", "" 'text', 't'""]"
