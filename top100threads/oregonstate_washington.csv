Well Washington has beat these teams but.....

Oregon is actually better, that was a quality loss for Oregon, but not a quality win for Washington as Oregon has already gotten much better

Arizona wasn't really good at the beginning of the season so it's not a quality win

Utah showed they're not as good without Cam Rising so we need to penalize Washington

USC and their Heisman are just no good at all, not a good win

Oregon State just isn't very good and we talked to ESPN about them and they agree it's not a quality win.
