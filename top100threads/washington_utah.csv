UW was in 12-pers, with two TEs, #88 on the line and #37 as an H-back off the line, and the RB #7 up on the LOS, though the play design called for him to be off the line. #88 released into the pattern along with #7, while #37 stayed back and blocked. Since both #88 and #7 were on the LOS that made #88 covered up and an ineligible downfield. Huard was correct, #7 needed to be a step back off the line. When he lined up after motion, he never checked with the short wing about his positioning, which happens with RBs since they're not as used to mechanics as WRs are.

They played an excellent “bend don’t break” game against Oregon then single-handedly won us the game against ASU. 

However after the ASU game they immediately and inexplicably got awful. Not just normal awful, either. They went from “not great but good enough for our offense to win it” to “so bad there is a legitimate argument to say they’re worse than USC.”

Before today there were excuses to gloss over the shortcomings. We were missing some starting DBs against Stanford. USC has a great offense so we shouldn’t judge our defense by that game. But today, against an offense that is statistically a bottom half in FBS offense, we are seeing exactly how bad things have gotten. 

So that’s how we beat Oregon while also looking this bad against Utah. Our defense was so much better when we played Oregon and now inexplicably it sucks. 

As for how Oregon held Utah to six, Utah’s offense isn’t that good and, unlike UW at the moment, Oregon actually has an FBS level defense.
