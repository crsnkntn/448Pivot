The NFL mostly values arm strength, anticipation, decision making when throwing the ball, and accuracy.  I'll explain that in reverse in an nfl context and with respect to Caleb Williams. 

Accuracy is a two part concept at the NFL level - it means the ability to anticipate and hit tiny targets with the ball, and it means the ability to identify where those windows exist given a coverage and the relative leverage of players on a given route with the appropriate kind of ball for the situation.  Instead of just hitting a man not near another man, it's hitting the correct part of only your man such that you achieve the best possible outcome - maybe some yac, maybe a safe place to catch a ball that does not put you in the hospital.

When not under duress, before this game Caleb Williams was doing this shit at an elite level. As you can imagine, a fair bit of the ability to do a lot of this is competition agnostic; you can get a feel for the skillet by looking at the film with an eye to where hypothetically better players might be that could make plays those on the field are not able to, and judge the throws in that context, not just with the actual defenders in that case actually did.  This is a huge part of where Caleb's hype comes from since he has incredibly elite raw accuracy and he hits these NFL windows regularly.  

The decision making is a harder one that takes a better football mind than mine to evaluate in detail - its more than a measure of outcomes, you can make bad decisions that do not get punished and a perfectly good throw bouncing off your player and being intercepted.  There is a lot of evaluation of missed opportunities - those don't show up in stats and even in most broadcast angles but do in all-22 coaches tape. As this is HARD, I won't comment here beyond suggesting that Caleb has not yet had a game this catastrophic in his career.  

Anticipation is another one that rapidly goes I to arcane football, but is something regularly highlighted in his games. What this really means is an understanding of defenses, protections, and how your route concept interacts with the potential defenses you are seeing, identifying your keys, and going the correct place with the ball before it's always evident your guy is going to break off a route to be there.  If the accuracy concept I described before is about dropping the ball in the right place based on what you *can* see, this is about dropping that ball in the right place based on shit that hasn't happened yet.   This was a huge part of Tom Brady's strength as a QB; he spent a lot of plays in a lot of his career being a whole ass step ahead of opposing defenses.  On a highlight basis, Caleb has been shown to be casual-audience good at the basics on this front but unlike the accuracy evaluation, this is far less competition agnostic.  This is the kind of thing you can only identify as being good when the reads are being challenged and what is being seen is not obvious. 

Lastly is arm strength, and this is the largest component of Caleb Williams NFL draft hype.  It is possible, with elite arm strength, to defeat certain components of coverage with raw power.  Proximate zones are all about the closing speed of a defender in response to a given action - the faster the ball gets there, the more you can 'shrink' an effective zone simply because there is less time for a player to react and close on a given throw.  You and I might be able to heave a football 20 yards, but an NFL safety can probably close on that fucker from  like 40 yards out, because NFL athletes are a freak of nature and the air we mortals would need to put under such a ball means there is a ton of time to react to that throw.  A real ass QB can deliver that same distance on a much more flat trajectory at a much higher travel speed, cutting that reaction time substantially. It's not a raw ball speed thing either - it means that a QB off-platform can be far more of a threat when not ideally planted than a QB with less arm strength would be.  That's a lot of Mahomes shit - the awkward sidearm and odd angle passes that go inhumanity far with inhuman accuracy all because he has the spare strength to make those throws with actual skill and control.  And this arm strength absolutely shines on Caleb's tape. It's not something that develops by large margins even across a multi year college career or after starting in the league; it's not something a player can replace if they don't have it at an elite level. It's why a guy who threw to the wrong team as often as Brett Farve had a hall of fame career.  

NFL teams tend to care way less about scramble discipline.  That's the kind of thing that will matter in the context of the other bits I described, but it tends to be the sort of thing where they tend to think a career long bad habit can be resolved by telling him to knock that shit off.  

Ultimately, Caleb's NFL success will be primarily predicted by where he ends up. If he goes somewhere that doesn't have their shit figured out he is going to look a lot more like Justin Fields - regularly running for his life and trying to force plays the roster around him is not making.  If he ends up with a competent coaching staff and good offensive line, he could have the liberty to develop into a pretty elite guy. Folks less physically gifted than Caleb have managed as much.  But I don't think he is as good of a prospect as CJ Stroud who did better vs tougher competition.",0,k4xb51z,t3_1780tdz,t1_k4xb51z,t1_k4x5ao6,/r/CFB/comments/1780tdz/game_thread_usc_notre_dame_730_pm_et/k4xb51z/,1,1,2.97,1.78,1.09,0.49,0.4,0.0,0.1,0.0,['michigan']

Issues with watching film and think talent alone will be enough. Not saying Williams doesn’t watch film but again reminds me of Murray where talent is all he should need and if it fails it’s somebody else’s fault.

People still watch ND football, the OSU game getting 15 million viewers at its peak proves that. 

I am in a huge minority that thinks, at this point, with how NBC neuters the home crowd and with how the stadium security neuters the home crowd, NDs a better road team at this point. Look at the ND @ FSU game from a few years ago when both were top 5 teams. ND fans were out in force during a road game and ND came out underneath an Irish flag. During the Holtz era at ND, you'd see those flags everywhere. You don't see that at home anymore, only when on the road.

First half offense today with usual second half defense — and we’d be a threat of sorts. Though, second half defense today is partially because the offense never gave them any rest. 

But I’ve sort of given up on us actually putting it together. People are far too enamored with Milroe’s deep balls (which float forever, anyway) that they’re overlooking how many easy completions he overthrows. Has no accuracy when rolling out. *Eventually* a better team will just start intercepting the floaters and the overthrows. Or we won’t be able to save ourselves from the brink in tight games because we overthrow a crucial 3rd or 4th down. 

The shame is that the defense is legit title-worthy. They don’t get enough praise for the showings they’ve had. But when you strike out as hard as we apparently did in recruiting QBs for a season or two, while relying so hard on Bryce, this is what we get. 

If we make the SEC title game, I’ll be pleasantly surprised *and* I’ll be willing to argue it’s a top 5, if not top 3, coaching job for Saban.",0,k4xgael,t3_1780tdz,t1_k4xgael,t1_k4xfl5p,/r/CFB/comments/1780tdz/game_thread_usc_notre_dame_730_pm_et/k4xgael/,1,1,2.66,1.6,2.13,0.53,1.06,0.0,0.53,0.0,"['alabama', 'mississippistate']"
