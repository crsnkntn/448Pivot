I DID just see a bama flair do the same... but i told em to stfu. They don't call holding until 4th qtr.

I am bitching just a tad about the PI earlier. The one replay they showed, the guy was already tripped up on the ground before the ball was thrown. Now you can argue Defensive holding, that is IF it fits that bill, and it probably does, as the holding rules are written that you can't even look at a player too long or you can get flagged. The thing is, those are different penalties.  10 yards for the holding as opposed to ""up to 15"" of the DPI, which they called as a spot and I have no idea how FAR that actually moved the chains, if it was greater than or less than 10.
