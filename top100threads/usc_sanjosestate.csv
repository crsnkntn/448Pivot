And it would make sense that they ask the schools entering the league which refs they think are better or worse (this goes same for asking UO and UW If they choose to do so). 

And here comes the conspiracy talk from the world is out to get me small program fan. Jesus you are the first beaver I’ve ever come across who has given me a sour taste about our fans. 

The objective truth is that in the last 5 seasons (22-18) SC has been called for the most penalties in the league (both total, and per game) the second largest penalty yardage per game deficit in the league (Shoutout ASU and Herm for having literally no discipline and one upping SC by a whopping  1.5 yard difference per game). The league average as a whole is for pac 12 teams to be called for (0.05) yards fewer of penalties per game than their opponents. In that time USC has been on average 11 yards per game more penalized than their opponents. 

Only ASU (80 lol that’s a TON)and UCLA (43) have larger penalties gaps vs their opponents than SC (39). If any program has been helped by the conference it would be Cal who has the second best penalty yardage differential in their favor (11.304 per game) and the largest net penalty gap in their favor (54 penalties over 54 games played). 

Not to mention the fact that when the League vice president of business affairs  called in to have a review overturned it went against usc. The sad thing about all this is you aren’t even an intelligent troll.

Refs, for the most part are correct on their calls.

Your the one with the dumbass conspiracy theory that the league is out to protect them at all costs. I’m just giving you mountains of data to show how that’s obviously not true. 

Hell in 2017 USC literally didn’t have a bye week and had to play 12 consecutive games, and one of those weeks they only had 6 days between games. What a gift that was from the conference to protect them. 

Or This, when USC was really rolling in the 2000’s their national rank in terms of penalties a game from 2005 to 2012 (70,81,111,114,88,98,63,120) good thing the league was protecting them and letting them choose their refs.

And they saw glasses ref literally All the Time! The league has like 7-8 ref crews right now! and even fewer before they expanded to 12 teams. Every single team runs into the same refs all the time. That’s how having conference employed refs works. Jesus you are stupid. The same way Mothershed’s awful crew was in charge of multiple  SC games last year. Including a game where the refs let the Arizona clock operator incorrectly run off like 9 seconds to end a half without letting usc snap the ball. And then just ran away as if they didn’t have any control of the game as referees. 

You are attributing malice to the pac 12’s incompetence. The refs and the league aren’t for or against a single team.
