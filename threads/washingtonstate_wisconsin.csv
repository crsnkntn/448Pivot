WSU and OSU have both been in this same conference for over 100 years! So even without the bylaws, which clearly show we’re the only ones now with the right to vote: We have every right to continue our conference legacy. I don’t care about the money. Split up this years revenue equally with the leavers. Don’t try to punish them. Hell, split up the ~90 million pending from basketball NCAA units.  We’re already financially left behind. Don’t care.     

In truth, I think the other school presidents just don’t want to see the Pac12 continue without them in it. Even if it’s no longer considered a “power” conference.  They want the conference dead so in the future no one can question their decision to leave. But fuck that! We’re not dead. Invite all of the Mountain West. We’re not going anywhere.

cougrrr,t2_8vnfh,1694309642,False,"My brother, a WSU graduate who followed in my footsteps, is getting married this September. To a lovely woman he met while attending WSU who is also a WSU graduate.  
  
The date they picked for their wedding is September 23rd, the day we play our real brothers Oregon State.  
  
One, this breaks the wedding on a Saturday in football season rule. Two, they both graduated from WSU so double WTF.  
  
The real kicker is, though, that my brother kind of coasted through his WSU degree and went to U-Doub after to get a different degree which he now works in the field of.  
  
My brother and I had a bit of a falling out a while ago, nothing that would make him dead to me for life, but enough to be at an arms length. I personally feel as though this was a direct attack at me and done out of spite, so I think the week of the wedding I'm going to go up to Greek Row in town and start licking handrails to ""oops got sick"" so at least I can watch the game on TV, because you can never trust these shifty UW graduates.",0,jzwbnnt,t3_16eiwlx,t1_jzwbnnt,t3_16eiwlx,/r/CFB/comments/16eiwlx/game_thread_wisconsin_washington_state_730_pm_et/jzwbnnt/,15,15,1,197,68.64,58.2,65.42,20.23,24.63,14.72,88.32,71.57,57.36,15.23,11.68,5.58,1.02,0.51,2.03,1.52,3.55,18.27,9.14,1.52,15.74,6.09,4.57,8.12,1.02,14.21,4.57,4.57,9.14,5.58,2.54,1.02,9.14,1.02,8.12,1.02,1.02,1.52,1.02,1.02,2.54,0.0,3.55,1.52,1.52,1.02,0.0,1.02,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.51,13.2,3.05,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.0,11.17,4.06,0.0,0.51,4.06,1.02,0.0,0.51,0.51,4.57,2.03,0.0,2.54,0.0,0.0,1.52,0.51,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.0,1.52,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.09,7.61,0.51,2.03,5.58,0.51,0.0,0.51,7.11,4.57,5.08,1.02,0.51,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.68,4.06,5.58,0.0,0.0,0.51,1.52,0.0,"['washingtonstate', 'chaos']"

TheReformedBadger,t2_ykew4,1694315695,False,"QB’s knee down in the end zone, spotted the ball at the 1 for a punt. Should have been 24-24

2 plays later the ball comes out. The refs looked like a deer in the headlights on the field and finally made a fumble call that they clearly did not actually see. Replay shows arm on the ground and the ball relatively stable in his arm but it “stands” because you couldn’t tell well enough if the ball was moving. . Completely deflated the defense and removed Wisconsins strong momentum. WSU scored on the drive that they shouldn’t have had and Wisconsin is suddenly 2 scores down with 3 minutes left.

LoyalSol,t2_6whm2,1694316542,False,">Dude you keep saying that but it’s not even fucking applicable. 

LOL I keep saying it because it's the damn rules bro.  

>If a player runs into their own end zone and gets tackled there, it’s a safety

It's if a player TAKES THE BALL into the endzone and fails to extend the ball out of it.  For it to be marked down in the endzone the ENTIRE BALL must be behind the line.

Try again.  You don't know the rules and this is painful trying to educate you on this when you clearly don't know them. 

>And where did the fucking “forward progress” argument go? You dropped that real quick. 

No where, because you failed to get this.  Forward progress is marked at the point where the ball is when the ball is moved backward by the defender's momentum.  The ball was clearly outside of the endzone when they happened.  Welcome to the rules. 

>And your argument now is that the dogshit pac 2 refs didn’t review it? Lmaooo.

UW had a coaches challenge, notice how they didn't use it for such a key play?

L0renzoVonMatterhorn,t2_7lco2,1694316924,False,"> It's if a player TAKES THE BALL into the endzone and fails to extend the ball out of it.  For it to be marked down in the endzone the ENTIRE BALL must be behind the line.  It's where the ball is not the player.

And the entire ball was beyond the line. This is not hard. Your QB was headed backwards and when he was down, the ball was beyond the line. Any idiot could see that. 

> Try again.  You don't know the rules and this is painful trying to educate you on this when you clearly don't know them.

Ironic coming from a guy who doesn’t understand a simple concept like “forward progress” 

> No where, because you failed to get this.  Forward progress is marked at the point where the ball is when the ball is moved backward by the defender's momentum.  The ball was clearly outside of the endzone when that happened.  You can't tackle a player into the endzone and get a safety.  The entire ball MUST be in the endzone and stay in the endzone to be a safety. Welcome to the rules.

Literally only the case when the ball is moving TOWARDS THE ENDZONE. Forward progress doesn’t apply at all if you’re moving yourself backwards. 

> UW had a coaches challenge, notice how they didn't use it for such a key play?  Oh wait, because Wisconsin coaches knows the rules unlike you.

They probably didn’t use it because it was 2 points and they were about to get the ball on the 35 with 8 minutes to go before the refs continued to fuck up and hand that dogshit team the game.",0,jzwrie5,t3_16eiwlx,t1_jzwrie5,t1_jzwqr3p,/r/CFB/comments/16eiwlx/game_thread_wisconsin_washington_state_730_pm_et/jzwrie5/,1,1,1,276,64.68,53.04,74.45,41.62,13.8,14.86,87.68,75.36,62.32,10.51,5.43,0.0,0.0,3.26,0.36,1.45,5.07,18.84,14.49,1.09,13.77,11.59,7.25,6.88,3.62,20.65,3.99,1.81,5.8,0.72,2.9,2.17,12.68,0.72,11.96,3.26,2.17,2.9,1.45,2.17,2.9,0.0,2.9,1.81,0.36,0.36,0.0,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,6.88,1.09,0.36,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.36,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.09,0.0,4.35,14.49,0.36,2.9,11.23,0.36,0.0,0.72,4.71,4.35,6.16,0.72,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.36,0.0,14.86,6.88,1.45,0.36,0.0,3.99,2.17,0.0,"['wisconsin', 'navy']"
