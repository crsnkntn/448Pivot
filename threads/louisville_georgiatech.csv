Another part is a lot of people look at it and say ok there's X first downs. Well they don't stop the clock anymore so that's something like 25 seconds times the number of 1st downs and there's that many seconds gone now. 


There's a lot of flaws with that. They only stopped the clock from when the play ended until the chains were set. A lot of times that was something like 10-15 seconds and it would start again. So 15 seconds times number of first downs is the theoretical maximum. Then you have to subtract edge cases like the 4 minutes it still stops, first down by penalty, any kind of official time out, injury, and when the first down results in a touchdown (I've never dove in enough on the numbers to but I'm assuming getting a touchdown counts as a first as well).

So yes there's definitely less game but when the announcers say stuff like ""this first quarter flew by because of the new clock rule"". Yeah no.
