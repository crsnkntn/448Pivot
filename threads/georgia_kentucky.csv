However, one thing that just refuses to fix itself is the passing game. Leary often throws it behind players or does the dumbest throws imaginable (he currently has about a 58% completion rate, with a 10/5 TD/INT ratio), and our receivers sometimes get routes wrong and/or drop balls constantly. It's like they're permanently out of sync.

So I would LOVE to think there's equal footing, but Georgia probably has more manpower here and there to grind out a victory.",0,k3ww93o,t3_172i5sr,t1_k3ww93o,t1_k3wveq6,/r/CFB/comments/172i5sr/game_thread_kentucky_georgia_700_pm_et/k3ww93o/,7,7,1,127,14.17,40.06,80.38,31.01,18.14,18.9,84.25,70.08,56.69,11.81,6.3,0.79,3.15,0.0,0.79,1.57,5.51,11.81,4.72,3.94,11.81,11.02,14.17,8.66,1.57,19.69,3.15,4.72,6.3,3.15,1.57,3.15,13.39,1.57,11.81,1.57,0.0,1.57,3.94,0.0,6.3,0.0,6.3,3.15,2.36,2.36,1.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.87,2.36,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.79,0.79,5.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.57,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.72,11.02,0.0,3.94,6.3,0.0,0.0,0.79,6.3,0.79,11.81,0.79,0.79,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.26,5.51,6.3,0.0,0.0,4.72,4.72,0.0,"['kentucky', 'kentuckywesleyan']"
