God how far we have fallen since the Tommy Tuberville years. Had a couple bright spots- the Nick Marshall year, obviously the Cam Newton year.

Look at Bo Nix- kid was pathetic for 3 years at AU and now he’s a damn Heisman candidate at Oregon.

I don’t know what the deal is, but AU just can’t get their shit together in the athletic department. I suspect much of it is allowing boosters too much power in decision making. They need to figure it out though because I’m tired of being at the bottom of the SEC every season.
