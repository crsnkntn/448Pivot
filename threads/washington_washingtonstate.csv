Cody667,t2_f0uq4,1700953198,False,"Stop speaking in absolutes when there's no reason to speak in absolutes.

If Texas gets to play and get revenge on 10-2 OU instead of playing 9-3 OSU, that's a pretty big difference and gives them the same argument we have of being able to say ""we beat everyone on our schedule"" if we also beat Washington.

Additionally, Washington losing today will likely see them fall below Alabama (as long as they don't lose to Auburn, which is also weirdly happening right now). The only difference in our resumes could be whether the committee views their Alabama win as better than our Washington win should we beat them in the SEC championship.

I'm going to say Georgia 1, Michigan 2, Washington 3, Texas 4...*if* Washington and Oklahoma State can pull it off in these tight games. If Washington or OK State slip up, that opens the door for Ohio State (because I'm predicting that Texas wins their CCG against OKST, but lose again if they're against Oklahoma). If both lose? Well, then Washington is right back in it. Georgia 1, Michigan 2, Pac-12 Champion 3, Ohio State 4 (to avoid rematch between Michigan and Ohio State in semifinals).

So everything cool about those rivalry games you just mentioned is now gone. The game is now essentially a pre season game between a well funded semi pro team of 6th year transfers and an underfunded team of 19-21 year olds who couldn’t play anywhere that would pay them. The outcome disparity is only going to increase which will decline most interest and do nothing positive for wsu football and Cfb in general.

We lose around 10-15 players to the NFL every year so if it's not a game for the national title, then we get young guys snaps to figure out who can step up next year. Most fans look forward to watching the young guys. I don't really care if we win or lose. I'm exited about next year. Everyone will have to beat a few good teams to win it all.

jah05r,t2_h9aot,1701742857,False,"I can't speak for Pitt-WVU aside from the endowment disparity (Pitt's is roughly 5x larger), but you better believe that Iowa-Iowa State has the same type of resource disparity as UW-WSU.
